NE and Post-reperfusion:

On portal vein declamping, we will start rapid 500 ml 4% albumin infusion or packed RBCs (according to the anhepatic hemoglobin level 5 min before declamping) through 14 Gauge peripheral venous cannula in all patients.

NE boluses technique; We will inject NE boluses in the C.V.P port of the pulmonary artery catheter with 5 ml saline flushing after each. After reperfusion, we will start bolus noradrenaline 20 µg if mean arterial blood pressure (mABP) decreases by 10 % or more of the basal reading (immediately before portal vein declamping after ensuring withholding of the surgical manipulation). Additional NE boluses will be given as follow;

If mABP rises to 65 mmHg (lowest target level), we will hold NE boluses.
If mABP remains constant or begins to rise but did not reach 65 mmHg, we will give 20 µg after 10 seconds from the previous bolus
If mABP continues to drop, we will add 10 µg to the previous dose after 10 seconds and can be repeated.
If mABP remains below 65 mmHg more than 1 minute, we will give the scheduled bolus NE with adding 10 µg adrenaline boluses.",['Postperfusion Syndrome']

This syndrome has different forms. Hypermobility type is the most common. It is characterized by generalized joint hypermobility, associated with a chronic pain syndrome. Pains appear as the most frequent demonstration of this syndrome, the worst lived and the most crippling.

Faced with insufficient effect of drug treatment, other alternatives have been proposed to relieve these patients. Compression garments have been developed. They appear as medical devices targeted specifically for patients with hypermobility EDS type: in the symptomatic treatment of joint pain, in stabilizing joints by proprioceptive effect and of muscle globulization, and in the functional improvement.

The VETCOSED study is a quasi-experimental study of type ""Before / After"", monocentric, open. The study is realized in the Centre Médico-Chirurgical et de Réadaptation des Massues - Croix Rouge Française de Lyon, in association with the Pôle Information Médicale Evaluation Recherche des Hospices Civils de Lyon. This study concerns about 40 patients with EDS hypermobility type, which will be followed for 8 weeks: 4 weeks during which they will wear a compression custom-made garment (short-sleeved vest CICATREX SED®), and 4 weeks during which they do not carry this garment.

The main objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of compression garments in the EDS hypermobility type, especially in terms of symptomatic improvement joint pain.

NCT01794858,GARD:0005698,"Therapeutic Hypothermia for Severe Acute Pancreatitis: A Clinical Model for ""Suspended Inflammation""",Therapeutic Hypothermia for Severe Acute Pancreatitis,"Background: Acute pancreatitis is characterized by a high mortality rate (10%-15%), and a remarkably unpredictable clinical course. Approximately 50% of deaths in acute pancreatitis occur early-within the first 14 days-and early mortality is attributable to sequelae of a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is associated with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) that can escalate to renal failure, respiratory failure, and death. Significant improvements in acute pancreatitis mortality will demand innovative approaches to counteract early organ failure. A series of destructive cellular processes begins within minutes of initial pancreatic injury, and the ensuing inflammatory cascade is compounded by disease sequelae including edema, ischemia, and tissue necrosis. Early interventions to reduce inflammation within the first 36 hours have been shown to have significant effects in minimizing progressive organ dysfunction.

Hypothermia is clinically employed to combat cellular injury and systemic responses following ischemia-reperfusion, and is been studied as a mechanism of acute inflammatory inhibition in processes including cardiogenic shock, lung injury, local intestinal injury, and reperfusion injuries to the lung, liver, and endothelium. In numerous studies, effective immunomodulations have been observed including reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), stimulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), inhibition of pro-apoptotic JNK signaling, reduction of systemic oxidative stress, and inhibition of neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Most saliently, in the caerulein model of murine acute pancreatitis, therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to reduce serum IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, increased serum IL-10, decrease serum amylase and lipase, lower the histological grade of pancreatic injury as compared to normothermic mice, and significant survival benefit. Although therapeutic hypothermia is actively employed in the treatment of traumatic brain injury, neonatal asphyxia, spinal cord injury, and cardiac arrest, no studies have yet been made of its application to acute pancreatitis.

Hypothesis: Patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (32-34°C) will sustain reduced organ-specific injury in acute pancreatitis.

Proposal: In a Phase IIa pilot clinical trial, we will examine the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on organ-specific outcomes during the early stage of acute pancreatitis. We will recruit five patients aged 18 to 80 receiving medically-necessitated ventilator support under ICU monitoring with core temperatures ≥36°C and severe acute pancreatitis defined as either a Ranson Score ≥7, a CT indicating ≥50% pancreatic necrosis, or a significant deterioration in clinical status including dysfunction of two or more organ systems (defined by ACCP/SCCM Organ Failure Guidelines, Chest 2009). All patients will receive current standard management for severe acute pancreatitis and a standardized protocol for application of therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming. Our primary endpoints are organ-specific cardiovascular, respiratory, hematological, renal, and metabolic dysfunction as measured at 28 days. Logistic Organ Dysfunction Scores (LOD) will be compared before and after therapeutic hypothermia, establishing day 4 versus day 1 changes in LOD. Secondary endpoints include D-dimer, IL-6, C-reactive protein, APACHE II scores on day 1 and day 4, inpatient and ICU length-of-stay, infection, mortality, and hypothermia-associated side effects including cardiac arrhythmia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia, major bleeding, and acute pancreatitis. We believe that such a study will supply preliminary answers to our chief research questions: does therapeutic hypothermia reduce morbidity as assessed by organ-specific outcomes, does therapeutic hypothermia attenuate the steep rise in inflammation observed in severe acute pancreatitis, and does therapeutic hypothermia shorten the clinical course for these patients.",['Pancreatitis']

The World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as an ""international public health emergency"" on January 30 and declared a global epidemic (pandemic) on March 11, 2020, due to the rapid spread of the virus all over the world. speed in the number of cases and deaths. Covidien-19 first cases were reported in Turkey on 10 March 2020 and the number of cases has risen steadily.

The total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide on 31.01.2021; It was reported to be 101,917,147 and the total number of deaths was 2,205,515 (https://covid19.who.int/).

Considering that the number of cases is constantly increasing, it is obvious that hospitals will not meet the entire epidemic burden. During this period, home care has emerged as an alternative way to effectively alleviate the epidemic burden. Home healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic; Four roles have stood out: home diagnosis, follow-up, treatment, and care.

Protective measures for home isolation of Covid-19 patients are the current method used to prevent the spread of cases. Possible or definite cases that do not have an indication for hospitalization, have a mild clinic and do not accompany severe chronic disease that may lead to a severe course of covid-19 are followed at home until their symptoms improve. In addition, patients who are hospitalized and meet discharge criteria can complete their recovery processes at home. Isolation is terminated on the 14th day at the earliest following the improvement of symptoms in patients who are followed at home. Reducing the contact of people, isolating certain and suspicious cases and effective use of personal protective equipment play an important role in combating the epidemic. It is thought that the training that COVID-19 cases to be followed up and treated at home will be effective in drug compliance, symptom management and quality of life will be effective in the management of the disease.

Therefore, in a future scenario where a new viral swarm is expected, the early identification of all infected cases becomes essential to plan and activate a containment strategy for the spread of the virus, given the current absence of vaccines.

The typical radiological finding of COVID-19 is an interstitial pneumonia, which can be responsible, in a significant portion of patients, of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Low-dose chest CT and simple blood tests could identify sub-solid pulmonary nodules (SSNs) indicative of COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic subjects.

Objectives of this observational study are the early detection of COVID-19 markers indicative of prior exposure or persisting viral infection in asymptomatic subjects and the assessment of the frequency and outcome of COVID-19-related SSNs in asymptomatic subjects by time, domicile, and other individual risk factors.

SMILE lung CT screening program cohort has been considered, based on 960 subjects at high lung cancer risk for tobacco smoking (≥20 pack/year) and age (50-75 years), together with inflammatory and respiratory profile. SMILE utilizes a top technology dual-source CT scanner (Somatom Force) with the lowest radiation dose ever applied to lung screening. All chest CT images from screening subjects will be re-evaluated by two additional CAD programs, specifically designed for the analysis of SSNs and quantification of the total volume of lung parenchyma showing an increased density. This re-evaluation will improve the sensitivity and specificity of radiomic assessment.

This study cohort, enriched by the already established longitudinal biobank of frozen plasma samples, represent an ideal opportunity to assess the frequency of SSNs in asymptomatic subjects, due to the effect of COVID-19, particularly among subjects living in areas at high risk of viral exposure. It will also be possible to evaluate if COVID-19-related SSNs are associated with chronic co-morbidity, other individual risk factors, inflammatory (CRP) / immunomodulatory (25(OH)D) blood profile, and/or can be traced by immune markers such as IgM/IgG and other cytokines.

Clinical data will be integrated with an analysis of the IgG-IgM profile specific for covid-19, on the plasma samples taken at the time of the CT scan, or subsequently, in collaboration with University of Milan, Luigi Devoto Work Clinic.

The lasting collaboration with the Radiological Science Department of the University of Parma in lung screening also offers the opportunity to validate the results obtained in this cohort on chest CT performed at the University Parma Hospital during the last two months in symptomatic subjects for suspected covid-19 pneumonia.

In collaboration with University of Milano Bicocca, Machine Learning (ML) tools will be applied to predict the clinical relevance, severity and ultimate outcome of SSNs, based on radiomic CT features, epidemiologic risk, co-morbidity and inflammatory/immune blood biomarkers. ML analysis will generate a predictive algorithm for clinical outcome of SSNs, and specifically the risk of COV-I9 infection and unfavorable disease prognosis.",['Inflammatory Status']

NCT04428112,GARD:0005925,Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Online Small-Group Self-Management Workshop for Rural Caregivers of Individuals With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,"These caregivers are a vulnerable group due to their physical isolation and well-documented rural disparities in health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depression symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depression symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).","['Dementia, Multi-Infarct']"

This has been shown in particular during post-pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The intensity of netosis is therefore an early factor in activating neutrophils and inflammation.

Pediatric solid tumors (Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma) are often difficult to cure with standard treatment.
Immune therapy using an experimental vaccine made from proteins from the patient's tumor cells may boost the body's immune response against the tumor.
The effects of chemotherapy on the immune system can potentially make immunotherapy more effective if administered soon after completion of chemotherapy. The addition of recombinant human IL-7 (interleukin 7) (rhIL-7 (recombinant human interleukin 7)) may make the immunotherapy more effective.

Objectives:

-To determine whether immune therapy given after immune suppression can help the body fight the tumor and to determine the safety of the treatment.

Eligibility:

-Patients with solid tumors, i.e., Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma whose disease has recurred after treatment or spread beyond the original site

Design:

Patients undergo tumor biopsy (removal of a piece of tumor tissue) to collect tumor cells for making a vaccine from proteins in the patient's tumor and apheresis (removal of a quantity of white blood cells) to collect white cells for re-building the immune system after immune therapy. Apheresis is repeated three times during immunotherapy (weeks 8, 14 and 20).
After receiving standard chemotherapy for their tumor (and an additional course of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to further suppress immunity if needed) patients receive immune therapy in Cohorts A and B. rhIL-7 is given 48 hours before the vaccine, as an injection under the skin in an extremity that will not be used for the vaccine in patients in Cohort B only. You will be watched closely for 6 hours after the rhIL-7 for any signs of reaction. rhIL-7 will be given before vaccine doses #1, #2, #3, and #4. The vaccine is given at study weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Each vaccine is given as a total of six separate rhIL-7 followed by injections: three intradermal (like a (tuberculosis) TB test) on one arm or leg and three subcutaneous (like those for insulin injections for diabetes). on the other arm or leg. An anesthetic cream may be used to minimize the discomfort of injections.
Patients' white cells are returned to them by infusion through a vein on the first day of immune therapy.
Imaging studies and immune studies are done at weeks 1, 8 and 20 to determine the response to treatment on the tumor and on the immune system.","['Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive, Peripheral']"

Most jaundice is benign, but because of the potential toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia an, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. Jaundice is a commonly observed, usually harmless condition in newborn infants during the first week after birth. However, in some babies the amount of bilirubin pigment can increase to dangerous levels and require treatment. Treatment of jaundice in newborn infants is done by placing them under phototherapy, a process of exposing their skin to light of a specific wavelength band.

These conditions initiate an inflammatory response characterized by elevated inflammatory cell infiltrates and proinflammatory cytokines that lead to the development of significant acute and chronic lung injury.

The study drug, rhCC10, is a recombinant version of natural human CC10 protein. Native CC10 is produced primarily by non-ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, called Clara cells and is the most abundant protein in the mucosal fluids in normal healthy lungs.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and anti-inflammatory effects of a single intratracheal (IT) dose of rhCC10 to intubated premature infants receiving positive pressure ventilation for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) to prevent long term respiratory complications referred to as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and, more recently, as Chronic Pulmonary Insufficiency of Prematurity (CPIP; asthma, cough, wheezing, multiple respiratory infections).

CC10 regulates inflammatory responses and protects the structural integrity of pulmonary tissue while preserving pulmonary mechanical function during various insults (eg. viral infection, bacterial endotoxin, ozone, allergens, hyperoxia). Together these properties suggest that administration of rhCC10 may help to facilitate development of normal airway epithelia and prevent the inflammation that leads to CPIP in these infants.

NCT00094900,GARD:0007132,Continuation of a Pilot Open-Label Study of IL 1 Trap in Adult Subjects With Autoinflammatory Diseases: A Therapeutic Approach to Study Pathogenesis,Interleukin-1 Trap to Treat Autoinflammatory Diseases,"Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses characterized by episodes of inflammation that, unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pathogenic role in several of these diseases. This exploratory study aims to examine the utility of the experimental drug candidate, IL 1 Trap (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in the treatment of adult subjects with the autoinflammatory disorders Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), and Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), and adult Still's disease. FMF is associated with mutations in pyrin encoding MEFV. NOMID, MWS and FCAS are associated with mutations in cryopyrin-encoding CIAS1.

This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility of IL 1 Trap in the treatment of subjects with diseases known to respond to IL-1 blockade (NOMID/MWS/FCAS) as shown by response to treatment with anakinra [Kineret]; 2) the response to IL-1 blockade of subjects with Adult Still's disease and colchicine-resistant FMF once the efficacy of IL-1 Trap has been established in NOMID/MWS/FCAS subjects; and 3) the biochemistry and genetics of autoinflammatory diseases and IL-1 related inflammation.

IL-1 Trap is a recombinant fusion protein with picomolar affinity for IL-1 and a half-life of approximately 7.5 days in humans. This agent is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and initial studies have shown activity against clinical and biochemical indicators of inflammation. Compared with anakinra, this agent may exhibit improved dosing convenience, potential for fewer injection site reactions, and improved efficacy due to the extremely high affinity of IL-1Trap for its target.

In this study, biochemical, genetic, and clinical correlates of autoinflammatory disease will initially be measured at baseline following a withdrawal of any TNF or IL-1 inhibitor medications where applicable. Subjects will receive a course of therapy with IL-1 Trap that is predicted to provide an estimated 3-4 weeks of anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic correlates of inflammation will be measured at appropriate intervals to ascertain response and to further elucidate disease mechanisms. Subjects will be eligible, based on clinical response, to enter a 1- year extension phase with IL-1 Trap. Those subjects who complete the 1-year extension phase, and maintain improved clinical and laboratory parameters compared to baseline values, may continue to receive study medication at their current dose until the study drug is commercially available.

Investigator comment:

This protocol (from the NIH standpoint) is a continuation of the ongoing protocol 05-AR-0014, with a new change in study sponsor, the NIH replacing Regeneron as sponsor. this protocol therefore still contains background and procedural information that refer to patients with FMF and FCAS and or MWS and Still's disease, however only patients with Still's disease will be newly enrolled from this point on, enrollment for the FCAS and or MWS patients has already been completed and it has been decided to not enroll any more FMF patients because the number of subjects is too low to reach reasonable conclusions, in addition it has been difficult to recruit patients that are eligible. The background section and study procedures have largely been left as in the currently IRB approved protocol.","[""Still's Disease, Adult-Onset""]"

Over 80% of the hemophiliac population who became infected with HIV prior to 1985 are also co-infected with HCV. Thus, hemophiliacs represent an important population for studies of the natural history of these chronic viral infections.

Moreover, the high rate of co-infection makes it an ideal group for assessing the interaction between the viruses and the relationship between viral specific immune responses and clinical progression.

Although the hemophiliac poulation is unique, co-infection by these chronic viral pathogens is becoming increasingly common, particularly amongst intravenous drug users, who account for approximately 25% of the HIV-1 epidemic in the United States.

Objectives:

The aim of this study is to determine if polymorphism in the promoter region of TH1 and Th2 cytokines are associated with (1) intracellular cytokines levels in CD4 + Tcells, (2) Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral loads, and (3) clinical progression of HIV1 to AIDS in hemophiliacs.

Eligibility:

The current proposal will investigate host genetic factors related to HIV-1 and HCV immunopathogenesis by studying children and adolescents enrolled in the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study (HGDS).

Design:

This study is in collaboration with the principle investigators of the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study (HGDS) as part of a grant ""Pathogenesis of HIV and HCV in Hemophilia: HGDS-3"" with funding support by NIH/NICHD for the period 9/25/01 through 8/31/2005.

This multicenter, United States study represents a well-characterized, prospectively followed cohort of HCV-infected hemophiliacs, of whom 207 are HIV-1 co-infected.

Enrollment of the hemophiliac cohort was completed between 3/89 and 6/90. The final observation of the cohort (follow-up 16) was concluded during 7/98. No new samples or clinical data will be collected on this population.

The LGD plays two roles in this project: (1) an administrative role overseeing the withdrawal, handling, and transport of samples from the HGDS/LGD and central repositories at the NCI-Frederick, and (2) a scientific role continuing investigations to determine the role of host genetic factors in Th1 and Th2 immune response and regulation of HCV and HIV viral replication..",['AIDS']

The central hypothesis is that the GMR measured using a simultaneous PET/MR scanner can more accurately detect residual tumor than conventional SUV measures from PET alone. It is important to note that SUV depends on both tumor metabolic rate and tracer delivery, which makes the interpretation of SUV challenging. For instance, inflammatory tissue can have high SUV due to increased vascularity and vascular permeability and cannot be easily differentiated from tumor based on the SUV. Investigators hypothesize that inflammatory tissue will have lower GMR than residual tumor that contain highly proliferating cells with increased expression of glucose transporters (GLUT). Measuring GMR accurately will improve the specificity of PET while maintaining the high sensitivity of PET for detection of residual tumor. In order to test our hypothesis, investigators propose to conduct dynamic PET and MRI scans with NPC patients who are undergoing a conventional two-stage chemoradiation therapy at our institution; the first stage for 7-week chemoradiation therapy followed by the second stage for 3-month chemotherapy. A combination of PET/CT and nasopharynx MRI is currently obtained before the initiation of treatment and 3 months after completion of treatment to assess treatment response.

This study proposes to introduce PET/MR scans at the time of these exams (scan #1 for pre-treatment & scan #4 for 3 months after completion) and to add two additional PET/MR scans in between them; one immediately after the first stage of treatment (scan #2) and another one immediately after the second stage (scan #3). A primary clinical endpoint of this study is the treatment response assessed at 3 months after completion of treatment. A secondary endpoint is 6 month follow-up exam. Complete responder will be determined based on clinical and imaging assessment of residual tumor size at each endpoint.

It is hoped that preliminary data obtained from this study will be useful in planning larger studies to formally investigate the utility of GMR for detection of residual tumor and prediction of treatment response.",['Nasopharyngeal Cancer']

Its distribution in different populations, in particular immunocompromised, has not yet been measured. The in vitro efficacy of lopinavir coupled with ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, on SARS-CoV, responsible for SARS has been discussed and this therapeutic combination is currently being evaluated in patients infected with COVID-19. The possible protective role of treatment with Lopinavir / ritonavir or another HIV protease inhibitor has not been studied.

In addition, patients receiving HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) share certain epidemiological and behavioral characteristics with HIV-infected patients.

Based on current picturing of the COVID-19, similar to SARS, besides direct viral toxicity, immune-mediated attack derived from either the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine perpetual cascade, or secondary pathogen-induced autoimmunity response may also play important roles on disease progression and partly account for the multi-system injuries related with COVID-19. Virus infection has been implicated in the initiation of autoimmunity, which can attack multiple systems. With the knowledge of characteristics of SARS, high level of autoimmune activity was shown to make severe injuries to lungs or other organs, leading to poor outcome including multi-system failure9. COVID-19 may also get autoimmunity involved which is of obviously younger and female population predominance during the pathogenesis, no matter pre-existing or secondary to viral infection.

NCT04511429,GARD:0009237,COVID-19 in Immunosuppressed Children,COVID-19 in Immunosuppressed Children,"Viral respiratory infections are common infectious complications after kidney transplantation, especially in the pediatric age group, and immunosuppressed patients may develop more severe disease. Immunosuppressive medications alter the patient's immune response by acting on humoral, cellular immunity and neutrophil function, increasing the risk of serious viral infections. Little is known about how these patients respond to infection by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

Experience with SARS caused by the Influenza H1N1 virus suggests that the severity of the disease depends on pre-existing comorbidities and the individual immune response. In more severe cases, an imbalance between the inflammatory system and the immune system is observed, determining direct consequences when pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines reach the systemic circulation in an exacerbated and unbalanced manner. Such fact can generate ""cytokine storm syndrome"", resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

March 2020 reports from Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy - one of the largest pediatric liver transplant centers - showed that the number of transplant patients infected with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) increased progressively. However, they did not see greater severity and complications in this population. Immunosuppression could act as a protective factor.

The present study aims to describe the prevalence of viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of immunosuppressed children, from three groups: kidney transplants, liver transplants and oncohematological. The investigators will also look for the epidemiological profile and clinical evolution of these patients, enabling a better understanding of the COVID-19 in this special population. The investigators' hypothesis is that infection with the new coronavirus may be asymptomatic in a large number of children and that immunosuppression, observed in liver and kidney transplant patients and also seen in cancer patients, may act as protection for severe forms of COVID-19.

After obtaining written informed consent from the family, the investigators will include patients from 0-18 years of age, on regular outpatient follow-up, symptomatic or not, and will check for the presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2. For those symptomatic or with a positive IgM result, material (oro/nasopharyngeal swabs) for RT-PCR trial for the new coronavirus will be collected. Demographic and clinical variables will be registered. The outcomes are: Serology for COVID-19 result; PCR for COVID-19 result; presence of symptoms of COVID-19; proportion of patients with viral shedding on days 3,7,14,21 and 30 after diagnosis; need for hospital admission; need for Intensive care admission; death.",['Covid19']

Currently there are no drugs proven to prevent COVID-19 or to reduce the severity of illness if given as prophylaxis. Although vaccines are now available, there remains a need for other prophylactic agents until vaccine use becomes widespread globally and effectiveness and durability is established, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, for whom vaccine responses may be suboptimal. Efforts are underway to repurpose established drugs with well understood drug interactions and safety profiles.

PROTECT-V is a platform trial to test prophylactic interventions against SARS-CoV2 infection in vulnerable patient populations at particularly high risk of COVID-19 and its complications, seeking to identify treatments that either might prevent the disease from occurring or may reduce the number of cases where the disease becomes serious or life-threatening.

In PROTECT-V, multiple agents can be evaluated on the same platform across vulnerable populations, with the option of adding additional treatments at later time points as these become available. The expectation is for as many sites as possible to recruit to all available trial treatments at any time, however, the platform structure and randomisation/data collection systems allow sites to open the trial treatment arms according to their capacity.

The trial opened with intranasal niclosamide and matched placebo, aiming to recruit 1500 vulnerable renal patients in February 2021. A parallel study protocol, will be conducted in India, sponsored by The George Institute. Recruitment of approximately 750 Indian patients will commence in February 2022.

The second agent, intranasal and inhaled ciclesonide and matched placebo, will be added to the platform in early 2022 in the same renal patient population.

No specific therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19 are available. Several therapies, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, are under investigation, but the antiviral efficacy of these drugs is not yet known. The use of convalescent plasma (CP) was recommended as an empirical treatment during outbreaks of Ebola virus in 2014. A protocol for treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with CP was established in 2015. This approach with other viral infections such as SARS-CoV, H5N1 avian influenza, and H1N1 influenza also suggested that transfusion of CP was effective. In previous reports, most of the patients received the CP by single transfusion. In a study involving patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection, treatment of severe infection with CP (n = 20 patients) was associated with reduced respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine response, and mortality. In another study involving 80 patients with SARS, the administration of CP was associated with a higher rate of hospital discharge at day 22 from symptom onset compared with patients who did not receive CP. Accordingly, these findings raise the hypothesis that use of CP transfusion could be beneficial in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to describe the initial clinical experience with CP transfusion administered to severe COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint of this trial would be to assess the tolerability, efficacy, and dose-response of CP in severe COVID-19 patients. The secondary endpoint would be to assess the clinical and laboratory parameters after therapy, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, reduction in the proportion of deaths, length of ICU stay, requirement of ventilator and duration of ventilator support. All RT-PCR positive cases with features of severe infection will be enrolled in this study. Apheretic CP will be collected from a recovered patient (consecutive two RT-PCR samples negative) between day 22 to 35 days of recovery and those with the antibody titre above 1:320.

This RCT will consist of three arms, a. standard care, b. standard care and 200 ml CP and c. standard care and 400 ml CP as a single transfusion. Twenty (20) patients will be enrolled for each arm. Randomization will be done by someone not associated with the care or assessment of the patients by means of a random number table. Allocations will be concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Clinical parameters [fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory rate, PaO2/ FiO2 level, pulse, BP, the requirement of O2, and others] will be recorded before and after CP.

Nonetheless, there are no data available in the literature regarding the implementation of interventions that are psychological interventions, let alone specific ones. In particular, the practice of mindfulness, formalized in the protocols such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), have proved to be very effective in reducing stress related to chronic conditions and of depression. However, these protocols typically require a high level of engagement for participants, which is why, in the present exploratory study, the investigators opted to evaluate the implementation of a Mindfulness-based protocol that is short and less intense, but which has shown good results on health-related outcomes, even with a single session.

Objectives: In this perspective, it becomes important to detect the presence of psychological distress in those who have contracted COVID-19 and are now undertaking a rehabilitation program, from the perspective of promoting well-being and prevention of possible aggravation if not prolongation of mental suffering in the long term.

Acutely infected patients shed virus that could be of major interest to characterize (viral quantification, characterization of virus shedding -of infective and of non-infective virus) the former reflecting/predictive of severity of disease and the latter reflecting extent/source of contagiosity.
Convalescent infected patients develop a specific anti-virus antibody response that is (likely) protective and therefore suits the preliminary requirement for the potential benefits of the convalescent patient plasma therapeutic infusion approach.

Study population. Subjects >= 75 years of age irrespective of presenting comorbidities or between 65-74 years of age with at least one comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic renal failure, and COPD) who experience the following signs and symptoms for less than 48 hours at the time of screening for SARS CoV2 by RT-PCR: (a) a temperature >=37.5°C and/or unexplained sweating and/or chills and (b) at least one of the following: dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, anorexia, sore throat, loss of taste and/or smell, rhinorrhea. Subjects consenting to screening will be tested by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal and an oropharyngeal swab and invited to participate when RNA for the virus is detected.

Intervention. Eligible, consenting patients will be randomized using an electronic system to receive 250 ml of convalescent plasma with an IgG titer against SARS-CoV2 spike (S) protein >1:1,000 (COVIDAR IgG, Insituto Leloir, Argentina) or placebo (normal saline 0.9%) administered in a 1:1 ratio. Both treatment and placebo will be concealed using dark bags and tape to cover the infusion line. Treatment will be administered <72 hours from initiation of symptoms. Subjects will be monitored for 12 hours after treatment for adverse events.

Clinical and laboratory monitoring. All participating subjects will be admitted to the hospital upon enrollment. Twenty-four hours after completing the infusion, a sample of venous blood (5 ml) will be obtained from all participants to measure anti-S IgG SARS-CoV2 in serum (COVIDAR IgG, Leloir) and preserved at -20°C until completion of the study. Patient evolution will be assessed daily by study physicians during hospitalization until day 25 and/or at home until day 15, in the event of earlier discharge from the hospital. Study physicians will use predesigned questionnaires to collect clinical information. An Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will supervise participating subjects during the study.

Endpoints. The primary endpoint of the trial is development of severe respiratory disease defined as a respiratory rate (RR)>30 and/or an O2 sat<93% when breathing room air determined using a predefined protocol. Three other clinical endpoints include (a) life threatening respiratory disease, defined as need for 100% oxygen supplementation and/or non-invasive or invasive ventilation and/or admission to intensive care; (b) critical systemic illness, defined as respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg) and/or shock and/or multiorganic distress syndrome; and (c) death.

Statistical analysis. The study is designed to have one interim analysis when the outcome results for 50% of the subjects is obtained. The minimally clinically important difference was set at a 40% relative reduction for an expected outcome rate of 50% in the control group reduced to 30% in the intervention group.

Recent reports showed renal abnormalities in COVID-9 infected patients. A recent Chinese study also reported that acute kidney injury was an independent risk factor for mortality. However, the exact mechanism of kidney involvement remains unclear: sepsis-related cytokine storm or direct cellular injury from the virus. Also, kidney involvement has not yet been well characterized: heavy albuminuria, hematuria or interstitial nephropathy alone.

The lesions in the acute phase correspond essentially to bilateral ground glass opacity more or less associated with condensations which would be markers of more severe infections.

The major scope of the lesions in the acute phase raises the question of whether or not the scanning anomalies are completely resolved over time, and the possible impact on lung function.

Indeed, the French Society of Radiology has recommended the performance of a CT scan without injection in thin sections in case of suspicion or for confirmation of the diagnosis in patients presenting initial or secondary clinical signs of severity and justifying hospital management due to the initial lack of reagents for performing biological tests (RT-PCR) and the high sensitivity of the CT scan and its specificity in epidemic periods.

The present study aims to study the kinetics of lung involvement in SARS CoV 2, to study the predictive character of the chest CT scan performed at the patient's discharge on the existence of radiological sequelae at 3 months but also at 1 year in order not to misunderstand the constitution of late fibrosis after partial resolution of the CT images. The investigatos will study the correlation between possible radiological abnormalities and the clinical presentation (patient symptoms and lung function). The rigorous follow-up of these patients will allow us to set up, if necessary, early treatment of the detected abnormalities (inhaled corticoids in case of bronchial or bronchiolar damage, study of the place of an anti-fibrosis treatment in case of fibrosis,...).",['CoV2 SARS Pneumonia']

They have also high rates of comorbid conditions and have varying degrees of immunosuppression, which puts them at risk of developing very severe forms of COVID-19 disease with fatality rates varying from 16% to 32%. In such circumstances vaccination is the only chance to improve their extremely poor prognosis. There is very little published data on the response to vaccination in dialyzed patients and kidney transplant recipients so far. No data are available on the efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19 in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). Furthermore, given the fact that disturbances of acquired immunity in dialyzed patients are many and diverse it is uncertain whether vaccinating against SARS CoV-2 in these population will result in sufficient immune response and, by consequence, protection against infection. Registration studies on the basis of which population vaccinations are actually conducted were performed only in the general population. There were no dialyzed patients and kidney transplant recipients in the study groups, so these patients are vaccinated with doses and schedules for people without chronic kidney disease. It is not known whether vaccination under such standard schedule produces a sufficient immune response in them and how long it lasts. That's why the aim of this study is to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response after mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 with which patients treated with renal replacement therapy are vaccinated in Poland. It will be a prospective, observational controlled study conducted in patients treated with renal replacement therapy (hemodialyzed subjects, patients treated with peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) vaccinated with mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 according to common rules and manufactures recommendations.The control group will be made up of sex and age matched people without chronic kidney disease.The first goal of the study is to analyze seroconversion rate and titer magnitude of neutralizing IgG and IgA antibodies directed against spike (s) SARS-CoV-2 antigen after the first and the second dose of mRNA vaccine as well as after 3, 6, 9, 12 months after vaccination. The second goal is to evaluate the cellular immune response tested using the ELISPOT method at the same time points as above.The immune response will be compared to patients without chronic kidney disease as well as between hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients.",['Vaccine Adverse Reaction']
NCT04463849,GARD:0009237,Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Beta-cell Function in Euglycemic Patients,Effects of COVID-19 Infection on Beta-cell Function in Euglycemic Patients,"In recent months, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been identified as the cause of a serious lung infection named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. This virus has spread rapidly among the nations of the world and it is the cause of a pandemic and a global health emergency. There is still very little scientific evidence on the virus, however epidemiological data suggest that one of the most frequent comorbidities is diabetes, along with hypertension and heart disease. There is no scientific evidence on the possible effects of this infection on the function of the β cell and on glycemic control. Clinical evidence seems to suggest that COVID-19 infection mostly affects the respiratory system, and an acute worsening of glycemic compensation is not described as generally observed in bacterial pneumonia. However, previous work on acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) caused by similar coronaviruses, had described that the infection has multi-organ involvement related to the expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, in different organs, especially at the level of endocrine pancreatic tissue. In the population of this previous work, glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycaemia have been described and in 37 of 39 diabetic patients examined, a remission of diabetes was observed three years after the infection. It is possible that the coronaviruses responsible for SARS may enter the pancreatic islets using the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme receptor, expressed at the level of the endocrine pancreas, thus causing diabetes. Additionally, previous literature on coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS or Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) suggested that diabetes could worsen the evolution of the disease. In particular, in case of Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV infection, diabetic mice had a more prolonged serious illness and a delay in recovery regardless of the viremic titer. This could probably be due to a dysregulation of the immune response, which results in more serious and prolonged lung disease.

There are currently no data on pancreatic beta cell function in patients with COVID-19.",['BETA-CELL FUNCTION']

Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe complications (severe pneumonia, hospitalizations, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and death compared to age-matched non-pregnant women. On the other hand, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) continues to increase, where the highest maternal mortality rates in the world are registered. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that this region alone accounted for roughly two-thirds (196 000) of all maternal deaths in 2017, which among other reasons is explained by the inequalities in access to quality antenatal care (ANC) services and the low numbers of skilled health workers in the region. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in SSA is threatening the already fragile health services, affecting mainly the most vulnerable populations such as pregnant women.

This project aims to describe the burden and effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in women living in malaria endemic areas and high prevalence of HIV infection. Pregnant women attending ANC clinics in selected sites from Libreville and Lambaréné (Gabon) and Manhiça (Mozambique) will be enrolled in a cohort study to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 during pregnancy and its effects on maternal and neonatal health. Participants will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection whenever reporting respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 during routine ANC follow-up and six weeks after the end of pregnancy. The presence of antibodies (IgG/IgM) against SARS CoV-2 in blood samples will be determined. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in pregnancy will be also characterised, and the incidence of infection during pregnancy and the risk factors of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the frequency of mother- to- child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will be assessed.

Clinical trials of antiviral drugs against SARS CoV-2 are currently in progress. Clinical study done by NIH which included 1059 patients indicated that those who received Remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days as compared with 15 days in those who received placebo. Remdesivir has recently received full approval for COVID-19 by US FDA, and emergency use authorization (EUA) by multiple countries including European Commission and Indian Health Service. Remdesivir appears to demonstrate the most benefit in those with severe COVID-19 on supplemental oxygen. The NIH Panel recommends using Remdesivir for 5 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. The interim analysis of WHO's SOLIDARITY trial, however, failed to show mortality benefit with Remdesivir. Review of literature suggests the transfusion of convalescent plasma has been used successfully in observational and retrospective studies. A recent metanalysis showed that convalescent plasma reduced mortality by 57% compared to matched-patients receiving standard treatments.

Physical and social isolation, home isolation, and quarantine policies applied during epidemic periods such as SARS, MERS, Ebola have been associated with lifestyle changes (Lippi, 2019). Much of the research on the health impact of epidemics and isolation has focused on psychological issues such as stress-related symptoms and disorders and to a lesser extent social support and stress management. In contrast, the epidemic and its associated lifestyle issues during quarantine and isolation, including the impact of dietary changes, restricted physical activity, and increased indoor and screen time, are still not investigated. A limited number of studies have examined lifestyle changes during COVID-19 and previous epidemic periods. However, there is no Turkish survey that comprehensively deals with the lifestyle, the scope of which is expanding, today. The Brief Multidimensional Lifestyle Assessment Scale, which we planned to validate in our study, is a scale developed by Balanzá-Martínez et al to multi-dimensionally evaluate the lifestyle changes that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak. It consists of 7 parts (Diet and Nutrition, Substance addiction, Physical activity, Stress management, Restorative sleep, Social support and Environmental exposure) and a total of 27 items.

Eligibility:

Adults age 18 and older who either currently have COVID-19 or have recently recovered from it

Design:

Participants will give a blood sample. For this, a needle is used to collect blood from an arm vein. For participants who have a central line, blood will be collected through that instead.

Participants medical records related to COVID-19 will be reviewed.

Participants who have recovered from COVID-19 will be asked to undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells. For this, blood is taken from a needle placed in one arm. A machine separates out the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the participant through a needle placed in the other arm. This takes about 2-3 hours.

Recovered participants may have material collected from inside the nostrils and/or rectum. This is done by gently rubbing the area with a sterile cotton swab.

Recovered participants may have an echocardiogram to look at their heart. For this, a small probe is held against the chest to get pictures of the heart from different angles. This takes less than 30 minutes.

Participation lasts 1-2 days on most cases and may be split in a few visits for recovered patients if leukapheresis and echocardiogram are done.

However, even if the specificity of the nasopharyngeal swab is high, its sensitivity can be affected by technical causes (sampling mode), as well as by intrinsic factors related to the method. The purpose of the study is to identify the clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristic which are similar or which can differentiate the hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia (with positive PCR on naso-pharyngeal swab) and patients with pneumonia with negative PCR for COVID-19. To do this, the investigators will compare the clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics between interstitial pneumonia secondary to SARS-COV-2 infection, confirmed by molecular biology investigations (viral RNA research by PCR on nasopharyngeal swab) and cases of interstitial pneumonia negative to the nasopharyngeal swab.",['Interstitial Pneumonia']

Chloroquine analogs have been shown to inhibit endosome acidification and exhibit nonspecific antiviral activity at high micromolar concentration in vitro against a wide range of emerging viruses (HIV, dengue, hepatitis C, chikungunya, influenza, Ebola, SARS, and MERS ). virus) and more recently COVID-19. On the other hand, azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic indicated for infections caused by sensitive pathogens, but which in combination with Hydroxychloroquine has shown a synergistic effect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

International studies show the lack of beneficial effect in hospitalized or mechanically ventilated patients. Referring that because these medications reduce the in case of having a beneficial effect it would be in the early onset, to avoid inflammation (cytokine storm), and thus prevent hospitalizations.

The present study focuses on characterizing the possible synergy of the fixed combination of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of Covid-19 from mild to moderate manifestations. Three treatment schemes are proposed with a 10-day follow-up, a) the fixed combination of Hydroxychloroquine / Azithromycin (combination of interest), b) Hydroxychloroquine (active comparison group) and c) non-active control group, using placebo. A group of patients between 18 and 75 years old is considered, who may or may not present other comorbidities. Follow-up will be carried out through quantification of viral load, evaluation of the systemic inflammatory state, changes in clinical manifestations and possible effect on the reduction of hospitalizations.

The biochemical test showed abnormal increase in related indicators such as interleukin-8, and CT images showed a medical ""white"" lung"". According to the experience of SARS treatment in 2003, the use of hormones will indeed help the patients to alleviate their illness, but patients who survived SARS either had too much hormone at that time and took too long. Although the lungs could recover, but the femoral head was necrotic Either the amount of hormones was very conservative at the time, which kept the lungs in the storm of inflammatory factors, leading to the emergence of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. So is there a medicine that can anti-inflammatory, reduce the load of hormone use, and have the effect of treating and preventing pulmonary fibrosis complicated by severe viral lung? At present, pirfenidone has achieved encouraging results in the treatment of idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (CTD-ILD) diseases. It is particularly encouraging that the values announced at the 2019 ATS Annual Conference suggest that pirfenidone has more anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects than its own outstanding anti-fibrotic ability. The data shows early use, Its strong anti-SOD activity can effectively inhibit IL-1beta and IL-4, and can open the prevention mode of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Based on the above, this project intends to make the following scientific assumptions: based on the homology of the pathogens of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia and the coronavirus infection of pneumonia in 2003, the similarities in the occurrence and development of the disease, that is, the pulmonary inflammatory storm occurs first, and thereafter The progress of fibrosis and the progressive decline of lung function and mortality are higher than those of ordinary pneumonia.

NCT04606069,GARD:0009237,Clinical Trial on the Safety and Efficacy of Regadenoson for Moderate to Severe COVID-19 Adult Patients,Treat COVID-19 Patients With Regadenoson,"More than 17 million people have been infected and more than 677K lives have been lost since the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, there is neither an effective treatment nor is there a vaccination for this deadly virus. The moderate to severe COVID-19 patients suffer acute lung injury and need oxygen therapy, and even ventilators, to help them breathe. When a person gets a viral infection, certain body cells (inflammatory/immune cells) get activated and release a wide range of small molecules, also known as cytokines, to help combat the virus. But it is possible for the body to overreact to the virus and release an overabundance of cytokines, forming what is known as a ""cytokine storm"". When a cytokine storm is formed, these cytokines cause more damage to their own cells than to the invading COVID-19 that they're trying to fight. Recently, doctors and research scientists are becoming increasingly convinced that, in some cases, this is likely what is happening in the moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. The cytokine storm may be contributing to respiratory failure, which is the leading cause of mortality for severe COVID-19 patients. Therefore, being able to control the formation of cytokine storms will also help alleviate the symptoms and aid in the recovery of severe COVID-19 patients.",['Lung Inflammation']

Under normal circumstances, staff may acquire and transmit infections, but the health impact of within hospital infection is greatest in vulnerable patients. For the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, like recent outbreaks such as the SARS and Ebola virus, the risk of within hospital spread of infection presents an additional, significant health risk to healthcare workers.

Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) teams within hospitals engage in practices that minimise the number of infections acquired within hospital. This includes surveillance of infection spread, and proactively leading on training to clinical and other hospital teams.

There is now good evidence that genome sequencing of epidemic viruses such as that which causes COVID-19, together with standard IPC, more effectively reduces within hospital infection rates and may help identify the routes of transmission, than just existing IPC practice. It is proposed to evaluate the benefit of genome sequencing in this context, and whether rapid (24-48h) turnaround on the data to IPC teams has an impact on that level of benefit.

The study team will ask participating NHS hospitals to collect IPC information as per usual practice for a short time to establish data for comparison. Where patients are confirmed to have a COVID-19 infection thought to have been transmitted within hospital, their samples will be sequenced with data fed back to hospital teams during the intervention phase. A final phase without the intervention may take place for additional information on standard IPC practice when the COVID-19 outbreak is at a low level nationwide.",['SARS-CoV 2']

The cause for ICU admission for most patients is very severe respiratory failure; 80% of the patients present with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) that requires protective mechanical ventilation.

Five percent of patients with SARS require extracorporeal circulation (ECMO) techniques. Global mortality data has been thus far reported in different individual publications from China. Without accounting for those patients still admitted to hospital, bona fide information (from a hospital in Wuhan) received by the PI of this project estimates that mortality of hospitalized patients is more than 10%. Evidently, mortality is concentrated in patients admitted to the ICU and those patients who require mechanical ventilation and present with SARS. As data in China was globally reported, risk factors and prognosis of patients with and without SARS who require mechanical ventilation are not definitively known. The efficacy of different treatments administered empirically or based on small, observation studies is also not known. With many still admitted at the time of publication, a recent study in JAMA about 1500 patients admitted to the ICU in the region of Lombardy (Italy) reported a crude mortality rate of 25%. The data published until the current date is merely observational, prospective or retrospective. Data has not been recorded by analysis performed with artificial intelligence (machine learning) in order to report much more personalized results. Furthermore, as it concerns patients admitted to the ICU who survive, respiratory and cardiovascular consequences, as well as quality of living are completely unknown.

The study further aims to investigate quality of life and different respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes at 6 months, as well as crude mortality within 1 year after discharge of patients with COVID-19 who survive following ICU admission. Lastly, with the objective to help personalize treatment in accordance with altered biological pathways in each patient, two types of studies will be performed: 1) epigenetics and 2) predictive enrichment of biomarkers in plasma.

Hypothesis

A significant percentage of patients (20%) admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 infection is expected to require ICU admission, and need mechanical ventilation (80%) and, in a minor percentage (5%), ECMO.
Patients who survive an acute episode during ICU hospitalization will have a yearly accumulated mortality of 40%. Those who then survive will have respiratory consequences, cardiovascular complications and poor quality of life (6 months).",['Respiratory Failure']

This pandemic is responsible of significant mortality. In France, several thousand patients are hospitalized in intensive care units, and their number continues to increase. Mortality during Covid-19 is mainly linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which frequency is estimated in France to occur in 6% of infected patients. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular conditions, obesity and diabetes increase susceptibility to severe forms of Covid-19 and associated mortality. Therapeutic management has three components: symptomatic management, including supplementary oxygen therapy and in case of respiratory distress mechanical ventilation; the antiviral approach; and immunomodulation, aiming at reducing inflammation associated with viral infection, which is considered to take part in severe presentations of the disease.

During Covid-19 viral pneumonia related to SARS-COv-2, there is a significant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the acute phase of viral infection, which could participate in viral pneumonia lesions. In children with less mature immune system than adults, SARS-Cov-2 infection is less severe. The current prevailing assumption is that severe forms of Covid-19 may not only be related to high viral replication, but also to an excessive inflammatory response favoring acute lung injury and stimulating infection.

The investigators hypothesize that early control of the excessive inflammatory response may help reducing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Computed tomography (CT) is a state-of-the-art study proven to be a highly sensitive diagnostic test complemented by RT-PCR testing to determine the disease and the degree of severity.

In March 2020, the Dutch Society of Radiology developed a standardized assessment scheme for COVID-19 lung disease, called CO-RADS. This system proposes a level of suspicion of pulmonary involvement of COVID-19, based on the simple chest tomography findings. The level of suspicion ranges from very low (CO-RADS 1) to very high (CO-RADS 5), with two additional categories involving a technically deficient study (CO-RADS 0) and a positive RT-PCR test for SARS -CoV-2 known before tomography (CO-RADS 6).

For its part, acute respiratory damage secondary to SARS-COV2 pneumonia causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, which warrants immediate medical attention. During the evaluation and triage of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-COV2 infection, it is a challenge for health personnel given that the severity and clinical presentation is highly variable. The patient's risk stratification is carried out using previously established and validated risk scales and is a fundamental tool for making clinical decisions. Some of the risk indices and scales have been developed and used in the pandemic epicenters, such as China and Europe. Useful for the clinician is the national early warning scale (NEWS 2), severe disease risk assessment score (COVID-GRAM), the rapid severity index for COVID-19 (qCSI), evaluation score of Modified sequential organ failure (mSOFA), the sepsis-induced coagulopathy score (SIC), the ROX index as a predictor of success to the high-flow nasal cannula. The evaluation of the risk of thrombotic complications such as the Padua risk, of cardiac complications such as QT segment prolongation, through the Tisdale risk score.

Risk stratification is essential in the current COVID-19 pandemic situation; upon admission, the clinician will discern if the patient requires in-hospital medical treatment, the risk of severe disease, and progression to assisted mechanical ventilation.

This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS.

Compared to SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak of SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission capacity. Although the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients have severe cardiovascular damage. In addition, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease may be at increased risk of death. Therefore, understanding the impairments caused by SARS-CoV-2 to the cardiovascular system and the underlying mechanisms is of the utmost importance.

Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are generally considered markers of lesions and may be non-invasive markers of pulmonary vascular dysfunction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another marker of endothelial activation could be circulating extracellular vesicles. They could also be involved in the spread of the virus.

In particular, since February 2020, a rapidly growing number of cases has been identified in Italy.

The clinical picture of ranges from asymptomatic cases, mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and death. In most severe cases, COVID-19 disease may be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and multiorgan failure.

It results fundamental to early identify those subjects who rapidly may worsen their clinical status, often requiring an intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

It has been showed that, mainly in more severe forms of SARS-Cov-2 disease, there is the development of an hyperinflammatory status resembling a cytokine storm syndrome, as already reported in SARS patients.

A recent study by Haung et al. reported that patients with COVID-19 infection showed high amounts of IL1B, IFN-gamma, IP10 and MCP1, probably linked to activated T-helper1 (Th1) cell responses. Those requiring ICU admission had higher levels of cytokines than those subjects not requiring ICU admission, thus suggesting that cytokine storm was associated with disease severity.

A similarity between cytokine profile of COVID-19 disease and secondary haemophagocytic syndrome (sHLH) has been reported. Therefore, it was suggested to screen all patients with severe COVID-19 infection both for hyperinflammatory markers (like ferritin), and the HScore commonly used to generate a probability for diagnosis of sHLH (8), which includes some laboratory parameters like triglycerides, fibrinogen, ferritin, serum aspartate aminostransferase.

NCT04262921,GARD:0009237,Clinical Characterisation Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections,French COVID Cohort,"Infectious disease is the single biggest cause of death worldwide. New infectious agents, such as the SARS, MERS and other novel coronavirus, novel influenza viruses, viruses causing viral haemorrhagic fever (e.g. Ebola), and viruses that affect the central nervous system (CNS) such as TBEV & Nipah require investigation to understand pathogen biology and pathogenesis in the host. Even for known infections, resistance to antimicrobial therapies is widespread, and treatments to control potentially deleterious host responses are lacking.

In order to develop a mechanistic understanding of disease processes, such that risk factors for severe illness can be identified and treatments can be developed, it is necessary to understand pathogen characteristics associated with virulence, the replication dynamics and in-host evolution of the pathogen, the dynamics of the host response, the pharmacology of antimicrobial or host-directed therapies, the transmission dynamics, and factors underlying individual susceptibility.

The work proposed here may require sampling that will not immediately benefit the participants. It may also require analysis of the host genome, which may reveal other information about disease susceptibility or other aspects of health status.",['Coronavirus Infections']
NCT04385095,GARD:0009237,A Randomised Double-blind Placebo-controlled Trial to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled SNG001 (IFN-β1a for Nebulisation) for the Treatment of Patients With Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection,Trial of Inhaled Anti-viral (SNG001) for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Infection,"SNG001 is an inhaled drug that contains a antiviral protein called interferon beta (IFN-β). IFN-β in produced in the lungs during viral lung infections. It has been shown that older people and people with some chronic diseases have an IFN-β deficiency. Many viruses inhibit IFN-β as part of their strategy to evade the immune system.

Addition of IFN-β in vitro protects lung cells from viral infection. IFN-β protects cells against the MERS and SARS coronaviruses (close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19).

SNG001 is an inhaled formulation of interferon beta-1a it is currently in Phase II clinical trials for COPD patients.

Synairgen has conducted randomised placebo controlled clinical trials of SNG001 involving >200 asthma and COPD patients. These trials have shown that SNG001 has:

been well tolerated during virus infections
enhanced antiviral activity in the lungs (measured in sputum and blood samples)
provided significant lung function benefit over placebo in asthma in two Phase II trials.

Synairgen believes SNG001 could help prevent worsening or accelerate recovery of severe lower respiratory tract illness in COVID-19 patients.

Patients who are in hospital or non-hospitalised but are a high risk groups (e.g. elderly or diabetics) will be invited to take part in the trial. The patient would receive either SNG001 or placebo once daily for 14 days. The severity of the patients condition would be recorded on a scale developed by the World Health Organisation and the patient would be asked questions about their breathlessness, cough and sputum every day, as well as assess their general medical condition and safety.

The study will start as a Pilot phase where 100 patients will be randomised in the hospital setting and a 120 patients randomised in the home setting.

Once each of the Pilot phases are complete, a Pivotal phase will be conducted. It is estimated that the size of each of the Pivotal phases (hospital and home) will be around 100 to 300 patients per arm. The actual number will be determined after the data review at the end of each of the Pilot phases.

If SNG001 proves to be beneficial it would be a major breakthrough for the treatment of COVID-19.",['SARS-CoV-2']
NCT03116802,GARD:0009237,Using Systems Vaccinology to Elucidate the Effects of Anti-inflammatory Therapy on Immune Response After Vaccination With a Live Attenuated Vaccine,Yellow Fever Vaccine on Statin/ Non Statin Subjects,"Since the 1st pandemic of the 21st century caused by SARS coronavirus, the world has experienced outbreaks of swine origin H1N1 influenza, Ebola and Zika viruses, which have all resulted in global health crises. Rapid mass vaccination with an effective vaccine such as a live attenuated vaccine, of vulnerable immune-naïve populations to establish herd immunity is an approach to control outbreaks. Such live attenuated vaccine had been used with great success in sporadic yellow fever outbreaks and recently successfully employed in Ebola field trial, both of these diseases have the potential for pandemic spread. Indeed, live attenuated vaccines have proven especially effective in controlling childhood diseases and have even succeeded in eradicating polio and measles from most parts of the world. However, deployment of such vaccines for pandemic control cannot be limited to children but must include adults in order to rapidly elevate herd immunity rates to halt transmission. Vaccinating adults may produce efficacy rates significantly different to those observed in children due to the prevalence of chronic diseases and their associated metabolic complications. Presently, there are 1 billion people who are overweight, many suffer from concurrent metabolic disorders. As activation of the adaptive immunity is reliant on a robust innate immune response to vaccines, metabolic disorders and long-term anti-inflammatory therapy with interventions such as statins may reduce vaccine immunogenicity resulting in suboptimal efficacy in this subpopulation. This study would therefore test the hypothesis that statins reduce live attenuated vaccine immunogenicity. We will combine a clinical trial with systems vaccinology approaches to define the impact statins has on the innate immune, B and T-cell responses to live attenuated vaccination. Our study will thus extend upon another recently completed trial by us and will provide new insights into the determinants of vaccine efficacy in a rapidly growing and aging population globally",['Yellow Fever']

On 11 March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate illness, for example fever, cough, tiredness and joint pain etc. For some older people, and those with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and malignancy are more likely to develop serious illness. Also long-term problems such as fatigue, breathlessness and joint pain experienced by survivors of COVID-19 after discharge from hospital.

Some clinical and pharmacological studies have suggested Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has achieved remarkable therapeutic effect for active COVID cases of different severity during SARS epidemic in 2003. Also, some studies shown that using Chinese medicine interventions together with conventional treatment is more effective than using the conventional treatment alone in treating chronic fatigue syndrome.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a long history and played an important role in the prevention and treatment of several epidemic diseases. However, there is a lack of clinical study of using TCM to treat the residue symptom of COVID-19 recovered patients.

Fatigue is a major component of COVID-19. Global muscular weakness is related to immobility, inflammation, corticosteroids treatment, hypoxemia due to pulmonary and/or cardiac infectious attacks and undernutrition suggests major physical functional repercussions. Thus, patients affected by COVID-19 with acute hospital management require sometimes complex rehabilitation management.

NCT04916561,GARD:0009237,Detection of Covid-19 in Tissue Samples of Orthopedic Origin: a Prospective Cohort Study,Detection of Covid-19 in Tissue Samples of Orthopedic Origin,"Background The presence of the Covid-19 virus has been detected in tissues of various origins: nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, blood, stool and anal swabs. However, it does not appear that the virus is excreted in the urine. The REACTing group (Research & Action Emerging Infectious Diseases) has demonstrated the presence of the virus in the conjunctiva and pleural fluid. This detection was made possible by carrying out quantitative, real-time RT-PCR and sequencing of the viral genes, which are currently the benchmark for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, it is not known at this time whether the Covid-19 virus is present in joint fluid or in bone.

However, some viruses have a particular bone tropism (Parvovirus B19, HHV6); others have joint tropism (parvovirus B19, HBV, HCV, rubella, HIV, HTLV-1). The presence in ""orthopedic"" tissues of the various coronaviruses (MERS, SARS, etc.) has never been evaluated in the past. However, cases of pulmonary contamination by coronavirus after bone marrow transplantation have been reported in the literature. A potential location at these levels could cause problems of different kinds.

Rationale First, and concretely, a possible direct transmission by these tissues. The current English and Spanish national recommendations in orthopedics show a controversy as to the risk of intraoperative contamination during medical procedures generating aerosols, in particular those involving instruments at high speed (saw blade, reamer, drill). This transmission could also be a problem during bone marrow transplants, from the iliac crests, for example.

Second, but hypothetically, Covid-19 could become quiescent at the level of the myelo-hematopoietic niches and reactivate at a distance, which could then explain the current interrogation on ""absence of immunity"" and cases of early revival in patients considered cured. This hypothesis is all the more likely since, always by analogy with Parvovirus B19 or HHV6, a recent alert on cases of myocarditis in children has been issued in Parisian pediatric hospitals and that treatment with tocilizumab, which blocks the action Interleukin 6 receptors, and initially used for joint manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, appear promising.",['COVID']
NCT04366882,GARD:0009237,"Increasing Our Understanding of COVID-19: Minimal Invasive Autopsies to Investigate Clinical, Radiological, Microbiological and Histopathological Changes in Deceased COVID-19 Patients",Minimal Invasive Autopsies to Investigate Changes in Deceased COVID-19 Patients,"Rationale In a very short time corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. The main cause of death is respiratory failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome, however the exact mechanisms and other underlying pathology is currently not yet known. In the current setting of the COVID-19 pandemic complete autopsies seem too risky due to the risk of SARS CoV-2 transmission. Yet, as so little is known, additional histopathological, microbiological and virologic study of tissue of deceased COVID-19 patients will provide important clinical and pathophysiological information. Minimal invasive autopsy combined with postmortem imaging seems therefore an optimal method combining safety on the one hand yet proving significant information on the other.

This study aims to determine the cause of death and attributable conditions in deceased COVID-19 patients. This will be performed using post-mortem CT-scanning plus CT-guided MIA to obtain tissue for further histological, microbiological and pathological diagnostics. In addition, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 will be examined by further tissue analysis.",['COVID-19']

Investigator have recently concluded a pilot phase II open-label RCT on the efficacy of convalescent plasma in severe COVID 19 patients in which encouraging results were seen. Investigator plan to further study the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 severely sick patients through an RCT. Investigator will collect up to 500 ml Convalescent Plasma from the COVID-19 recovered persons after 14 days of clinical recovery with two consecutive SARS CoV-2 negative tests by PCR at least 24 hours apart. This plasma will be tested and frozen and stored. On requisition it will be thawed and sent to the treating center.

Almost 100 million people around the world have contracted COVID-19 to date and over 2 million people have died of COVID-19 by the end of January 2021.

Despite the tragedy of these deaths, it must be pointed out at this point that the number of COVID-19 survivors is significantly larger. These COVID-19 survivors are now the focus of interest in rehabilitation measures, as it has been shown that survival of the disease does not go hand in hand with a complete cure. Thirty-five percent of all COVID-19 survivors and 87% of the COVID-19 survivors who were hospitalized in the course of their illness suffer from after-effects that are currently summarized as post-COVID fatigue syndrome also known as ""Long-COVID"".

As health care workers are at higher risk of contracting SARS CoV2 and furthermore, considering their central role in the overcoming of this pandemic, a COVID-19 rehabilitation program for healthcare workers of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria as well as the General Hospital of Vienna, Austria - together the second-largest university-clinic in the world - was developed as part of workplace health promotion. Nowadays, the fatigue syndrome is primarily known as a side effect of cancer treatment and thus from the rehabilitation of cancer patients. Cancer-related fatigue is a massive limiting side effect for patients and the currently most effective treatment strategy against cancer-associated fatigue syndrome is physical training.

The idea for this current project is, that physical exercise might have similar effects on post-SARS-CoV2 fatigue as it has on cancer-related fatigue.

The current study evaluates the effects of this primarily exercise-based rehabilitation program on Long-COVID fatigue.",['COVID-19']
