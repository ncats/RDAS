Volunteers between the ages of 14 and 65 will be screened in order to identify 240 volunteers (160 Wb+Mp+ and 80 Wb-Mp+) for participation in an open label randomized trial of doxycycline (200 mg daily for 6 weeks). Wb+Mp+ subjects will then be randomized to receive single dose treatment with albendazole and ivermectin 4 months after completion of the doxycycline treatment or no further treatment. Clinical, parasitologic and immunologic assessments will be performed prior to the initiation of treatment and at 6 months and 1 year and 3 years following initiation of treatment.

Severe fat-soluble vitamin deficiency results even despite mega doses of oral fat-soluble vitamins.

This 24/7 attention to their child's health manifests in elevated rates of parental perception of stress and increased risk for depression and anxiety. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms for parents of children with T1D range from 21-59%; depressive symptoms from 10-74%; psychological distress from 29-33%; and posttraumatic stress symptoms from 19-24%.7-9 Parental psychological distress has negative health implications for the parent, the overall functioning of the family, the psychological adjustment of their child with T1D, diabetes management, and child metabolic control.10-14 The goal of this application is to complete the psycho-educational web-based program for parents of adolescents with T1D (Type1Teamwork) which will help to: 1) decrease parental perceived stress and distress; 2) promote parental adjustment to the developmental transitions in adolescence; 3) support adolescent autonomy and transfer of diabetes responsibility from parent to adolescent; 4) decrease family conflict; and 5) maintain metabolic control during adolescence.

The proposed protocol is a proof of principle study designed to determine if administration of rhuCD40L can reverse the core immunologic defects of patients with XHIM. To this end, we will immunize patients with neo antigens, specifically keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and Bacteriophage Phi-X 174 (PhiX174) to evaluate antigen-specific B and T cell responses. Clinical response and toxicity will be evaluated using routine hematological and clinical evaluation, quantitation of KLH and PhiX174 specific IgG in serum, measurement of proliferation and cytokine production to KLH simulation in vitro, and FACS analysis to quantitate memory B and T cells.

It is hypothesized that decreased glycogen degradation leads to energy deficit in the nervous system cells. Therefore, anaplerotic therapy may supply needed substrate to the citric acid cycle to correct the energy deficit. This intervention may slow, halt or reverse the progression of the disease, for which there is no effective treatment.

All these disorders derive from mutation of a unique gene, named MYH9, and they have been recognized as different clinical presentations of a single illness that was named MYH9RD. All patients affected by MYH9RD present since birth with thrombocytopenia, which can result in a variable degree of bleeding diathesis; some of them subsequently develop additional clinical manifestations, such as renal damage, sensorineural hearing loss, and/or presenile cataracts. Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes, the bone marrow cells that produce blood platelets. This drug is effective in increasing platelet count in healthy volunteers, as well as in patients affected by some acquired thrombocytopenias, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and HCV related thrombocytopenia. The purpose of this study is to determine if eltrombopag, administered orally at the dose of 50 or 75 mg/daily for up to 6 weeks, is effective in increasing platelet count of patients affected by MYH9RD. Further aims of this study are to test if eltrombopag is effective in reducing bleeding tendency of MYH9RD patients; to evaluate safety and tolerability of eltrombopag in patients with MYH9RD; to evaluate in vitro function of platelets produced during therapy in patients responding to this drug.","Efficacy of Eltrombopag to Improve Thrombocytopenia of MYH9-related Disease",-,-,-,-,-,"OTHER","Fondazione Telethon","June 2010","Actual","Blood Platelet Disorders","D000006402","Hematologic Diseases","Rare","Rare Diseases","MYH9-related Disease","T4003","MYH9 Related Thrombocytopenia","high","D000001791","Blood Platelet Disorders",-,"N/A","Single Group Assignment",-,"None (Open Label)",-,-,"Treatment",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","12","Actual",-,-,"Eltrombopag, administered orally, 50 mg/daily for 21 days.

Lung disease, liver disease and cancer are other frequent causes of illness and death. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can cure the blood system but can make the lung and liver disease and risk of cancer worse, because of DNA damaging agents such as alkylators and radiation that are typically used in the procedure. Based on the biology of DC, we hypothesize that it may be possible to avoid these DNA damaging agents in patients with DC, and still have a successful BMT. In this protocol we will test whether a regimen that avoids DNA alkylators and radiation can permit successful BMT without compromising survival in patients with DC.","Radiation- and Alkylator-free Bone Marrow Transplantation Regimen for Patients With Dyskeratosis Congenita","suneet.agarwal@childrens.harvard.edu","Suneet Agarwal, MD, PHD","617-919-7579",-,"Contact","OTHER","Massachusetts General Hospital","December 2034","Anticipated","Aplastic Anemia","D000012871","Skin Diseases","Rare","Rare Diseases","Hoyeraal Hreidarsson Syndrome","T2838","Hoyeraal Hreidarsson Syndrome","high","D000013577","Syndrome",-,"N/A","Single Group Assignment",-,"None (Open Label)",-,-,"Treatment",-,-,"Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited multisystem disorder, which classically presents with a clinical triad of skin pigment abnormalities, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia. DC is part of a spectrum of telomere biology disorders, which include some forms of inherited idiopathic aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis and the congenital diseases Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome and Revesz syndrome. Progressive bone marrow failure (BMF) occurs in more than 80% of patients under 30 years of age and is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality, followed by pulmonary failure and malignancies. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is curative for the hematological defects, but several studies have demonstrated poor outcomes in DC patients due to increased early and late complications. A predisposition to pulmonary failure, vascular disease and secondary malignancies may contribute to the high incidence of fatal complications following HCT in DC patients, and provides an impetus to reduce exposure to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparative regimens. Recent studies suggest that fludarabine-based conditioning regimens provide stable engraftment and may avoid the toxicities seen after HCT for DC, but studies to date are limited to case reports, retrospective studies and a single prospective trial. In this study, we propose to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of a fludarabine- and antibody-based conditioning regimen in HCT for DC patients, with the goals of maintaining donor hematopoiesis and transfusion independence while decreasing early and late complications of HCT for DC.",-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","40","Anticipated",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","No","Undecided",-,-,-,-,-,"D000074322","Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological","alemtuzumab/fludarabine conditioning","Derm","Dermatologic Agents","Diameter","M1346","Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological","low","fludarabine 30 mg/m2/dose IV x 6 doses","D000003524","Cyclosporins","Tacrolimus","Prograf","Drug",-,-,-,-,-,"telomere",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"April 29, 2022","Actual","April 23, 2022","OTHER","Boston Children's Hospital",-,"Stockholm","mikael.c.sundin@sll.se","Mikael Sundin, MD, PHD","+46 8 585 848 43",-,"Principal Investigator","Sweden","Karolinska University Hospital","Wisconsin","Recruiting","53792","65 Years",-,"NCT01659606",-,"Radiation- and Alkylator-free Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Bone Marrow Failure Due to Dyskeratosis Congenita / Telomere Disease","OTHER","Boston Children's Hospital","12-950",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Boston Children's Hospital","Suneet Agarwal, MD, PHD","Principal Investigator","Recruiting","Yes",-,"Phase 2",-,-,-,-,-,"December 2022","Anticipated",-,"Primary engraftment","Up to day +100 post-BMT","Bhoopalan SV, Wlodarski M, Reiss U, Triplett B, Sharma A.

Furthermore, in an effort to prevent relapse, we have moved oral-As2O3 forward to the maintenance of CR1. This strategy results in favorable overall-survival (OS) and leukemia-free-survival (LFS), implying that prolonged treatment with oral-As2O3 may prevent relapses. Current protocols have incorporated i.v.-As2O3 in the treatment of newly-diagnosed APL.

Research in the field of environmental psychology has helped to highlight the influence of the environment on patients with Alzheimer's disease or related syndromes. With regard to spatial orientation, it has been shown that an environment can provide support for cognitive failures in subjects if that particular space is adapted. While numerous studies have focused on the architectural environment (hospital, housing facility), none have explored the ability of patients to orient themselves in a natural environment such as a garden. Yet, in recent years, such gardens, known as healing gardens, have emerged in housing and care facilities, providing genuine support for the care management of patients with Alzheimer-type dementia. Various works have been published outlining recommendations for their management. However, with regard to spatial orientation, none of the available research has explored the basic principles on which to rely on in order to organize the elements of outdoor spaces into itineraries that promote orientation, according to ZEISEL and TYSON (1999). In the absence of such data, these authors recommend relying on five elements, identified by Lynch in his landmark book &quot;Image of the City&quot; (1960), that people use to orient themselves and find their way. These are &quot; paths &quot;, &quot; edges &quot;, &quot; districts &quot;, &quot; nodes &quot; and &quot; landmarks &quot;. The hypothesis to verify is that patients with Alzheimer's disease do not rely on the same elements of the garden as non-Alzheimer's subjects in making orientation decisions and to mentally picture this environment.","What Elements of the Design of a Healing Garden Are Used as Landmarks by Patients With Alzheimer's Disease to Locate?",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"October 2014","Actual","Alzheimer Disease","D000001523","Mental Disorders","Rare","Rare Diseases","Alzheimer's Disease","T2192","Familial Alzheimer Disease","high","D000000544","Alzheimer Disease",-,"Non-Randomized","Parallel Assignment",-,"None (Open Label)",-,-,"Diagnostic",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","77","Actual",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","Accepts Healthy Volunteers",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"control",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"neuropsychological assessment",-,"Other",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"July 30, 2015","Estimate","July 29, 2015","OTHER","Central Hospital, Nancy, France",-,"Nancy",-,-,-,-,-,"France","University Hospital of Nancy , Saint Julien Hospital, France",-,-,"54000","90 Years","65 Years","NCT01692977",-,"Orienting Oneself in a Healing Garden: What Elements of the Design Are Used as Landmarks by Patients With Alzheimer's Disease ?","OTHER","Central Hospital, Nancy, France","2011-A00993-38",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"University Hospital of Nancy, France","Thérèse Rivasseau Jonveaux, PhD","Principal Investigator","Completed","No",-,"Not Applicable",-,-,-,-,-,"October 2014","Actual","To describe and compare nature and frequency of elements involved in orientation decisions and the cognitive map, between a group of subjects with Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy control subjects.","Analyze nature and frequency of elements of the &quot; art, memory and life &quot; garden used as landmarks by Alzheimer's disease patients","Baseline = inclusion visit",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Sponsor",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"To study the correlation between the degree of success in experimental tasks (route learning, cognitive map) and standard and specific neuropsychological assessment (visuospatial skills) of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and healthy control subjects.","Study the characteristics of the elements that contributed to decision-making regarding spatial orientation, the cognitive map, correlations between success in experimental, neuropsychological assessment in Alzheimer disease and healthy control subjects.","Baseline = inclusion visit",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"August 2012",-,"July 2015","Older Adult","September 26, 2012","Estimate","August 16, 2012","September 21, 2012",-,"Interventional",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 28, 2022",-

Together they are estimated to result in 50 million cases of colitis and liver abscess and 100,000 deaths worldwide each year. In developing countries, colonization with E. histolytica has been observed in 5% or more of poor children. Patients with amebic colitis typically present with a several week history of gradual onset of abdominal pain and tenderness, diarrhea and bloody stools (dysentery). The pathological lesions in the colon include ulceration of the intestinal epithelium and invasion into the lamina propria by trophozoites. Inflammation, with infiltrating neutrophils and mononuclear lymphocytes is pronounced, but inflammatory cells near the amebae are killed with pyknotic nuclei characteristic of apoptotic death. Amebic liver abscess is a rare form of the disease that is almost exclusively limited to adul",-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","629","Actual",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Undecided",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"October 26, 2017","Actual","October 24, 2017","OTHER","University of Virginia",-,"Dhaka",-,-,-,-,-,"Bangladesh","The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh",-,-,-,"7 Days",-,"NCT02734264",-,"Field Studies of Human Immunity to Amebiasis in Bangladesh: A Prospective Study of Children Ages 0-17 Years","OTHER","University of Virginia","7563",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"University of Virginia","William A Petri, M.D., PhD","Principal Investigator","Completed","No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,"December 2014","Actual",-,"Incidence of Amebiasis and Cryptosporidium infection","Birth to 5 years","Zhang Y, Zhou J, Niu F, Donowitz JR, Haque R, Petri WA Jr, Ma JZ.

In 2009, 2340 patients in the UK were diagnosed with thyroid cancer with 70-90 expected to be the anaplastic subtype 1,2. For these patients average life expectancy is in the range of 2-6 months with only a very small number surviving for more than one year. It is a highly aggressive form of cancer that is refractory to current treatment options. By collecting tissue and blood samples along with clinical data across the UK we will be able to accumulate numerically significant numbers of samples and data points which will facilitate research opportunities. Researchers will be encouraged to apply for access to the collected samples in order to try and establish the causal mechanisms for disease development, potential therapeutic targets and to relate clinical course and outcome with specific molecular defects.

Recent evidence based data suggested new modalities to increase the quality and accerelate sternal healing in high risk patients after open heart surgery vulnerable for early sternal dehiscence (Liu 2002) . PRP considers as an attractive alternative option in that manner. Marx and associates demonstrated the positive influence of PRP on bone regeneration and healing since 1998 (Marx 1998 ) . Autologous PRP carries minimal risk of infectious diseases transmission, immunologic reactions, and rejection. PRP with concentrations 4 to 5 folds of the normal average platelet (1,100,000 platelets/μl ) proved to have a remarkable increase in bone mineral density and regeneration . the market for PRP grows from $45 million in 2009 to more than $120 million by 2016 (Dawood 2018 ). Multiple factors affect the PRP efficacy in sternal bone healing and regeneration process. Platelet preparation before surgical application is an area of concern with PRP. For this issue, an appropriate anticoagulant must be used to prevent the early spontaneous activation of the platelets (Kassolis 2000 ). Several anticoagulants have been employed for PRP preparation including heparin, citrate, acid-citrate-dextrose solution A or anticoagulant citrate dextrose-A ,citrate-phos phate-dextrose ,citrate-theophylline-adenosine- dipyrimadole and ethylene diamine tetra- acetic acid moreover, several manual or automated systems have been designed for preparing PRP including clinical laboratory methods and kits (Carlson 2002). PRP produced by single- or double-step centrifugation technology via platelet-pheresis (autologous selective filtration )and the cell separators,However, these methods are rarely used nowadays, due to several factors including high cost, large volume of peripheral blood should be harvested from the patients, and potentially damage to the platelet (Dhurat 2014) . Commercially available PRP kits and devices differ in ease of use, one or two step centrifugation protocols, centrifugation speed, final PRP volume, platelet count and activation, platelet and growth factor concentrations, and final RBCs' and WBCs' count.Nevertheless, the cost of the commercial kits for PRP processing is still a challenge (Trebinjac",-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","50","Anticipated",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Yes","IPD sharing access criertia including clinical researcher cardiac surgeons postgraduate investigator","planning to make IPD available to other researchers","Analytic Code","data will be available after 3 YEARS and for 2 years.","http://www.ctaegypt.org",-,-,"We will apply 10cm saline on the sternal edge before sternal closure",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Patient data will be collected preoperatively and intraoperatively and these risk factors will be studied Patients will be distributed to two equal groups.

TAA and other forms of aortopathy (e.g. aortic tortuosity or aortic hypoplasia/stenosis) develop in the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular malformations including bicuspid aortic valve. TAA is associated with connective tissue disorders (e.g. Marfan syndrome), and familial clustering has been identified in a significant proportion of nonsyndromic cases, establishing high heritability. Pedigree analysis of TAA kindreds clearly identifies complex inheritance; however, progress towards understanding the genetic basis of TAA and other forms of aortopathy and, ultimately, the susceptibility to aortic dissection remains incomplete. There is a clinical need to develop novel methods for predicting disease risk based on genotype and phenotype, to further elucidate the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of aortopathy, and to improve medical and surgical therapies. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that individual genetic variation modulates susceptibility to disease severity and progression. The goals of this study are 1) to ascertain a cohort of subjects who have aortopathy and/or aortic valve disease including TAA or who have genetic risk for the development of aortopathy and/or aortic valve disease, 2) to collect paired blood and tissue samples from well-characterized subjects, family members of subjects, and controls to perform genome-wide DNA sequence, histopathologic, transcriptional, and proteomic analyses, and 3) to establish a tissue biorepository with detailed phenotype information to facilitate a broad spectrum of current and future studies.",-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","3000","Anticipated",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Cardiovascular Disease",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"January 20, 2022","Actual","January 19, 2022","OTHER","Indiana University",-,"Indianapolis","benjland@iu.edu","Benjamin Landis, MD","317-278-2808",-,"Contact","United States","IU School of Medicine","Indiana","Recruiting","46202",-,-,"NCT03440697",-,"Pathogenetic Basis of Aortopathy and Aortic Valve Disease","OTHER","Indiana University","1509977311",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"IU School of Medicine","Benjamin Landis, MD","Principal Investigator","Recruiting","No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,"December 2025","Anticipated","The mechanisms of TAA pathogenesis will be determined by studying explanted aortic tissue and cells derived from patients with TAA for gene expression, protein expression, and other functional assays.","DNA Sequence Analysis","10 years",-,-,-,-,"Indiana University","Benjamin Landis","Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Medical and Molecular Genetics",-,-,"Principal Investigator",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Non-Probability Sample",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"December 2015",-,"January 2022","Older Adult","February 22, 2018","Actual","October 6, 2017","February 19, 2018","Families affected by aortopathy, aortic valve disease, or syndromic or genetic diagnosis that poses risk for the development of aortic disease who have not yet developed disease.","Observational",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 28, 2022",-

The research of the pathogenic mechanisms in DISH, is significantly hampered by the late diagnosis resulting from this definition.Based on recent MRI studies in both axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and in DISH, it seems that changes similar to the classical early inflammatory changes described in axSpA, can be detected in patients with DISH. We therefore hypothesize, that patients with metabolic syndrome without radiographic evidence for spinal DISH, might exhibit early MRI changes. If this hypothesis proves to be correct, early diagnosis and research of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms at this early stage might be very rewarding in investigations of the early aberrations of the entheses homeostasis and eventually early, more targeted therapeutic interventions.

CBD is an inflammatory hypersensitivity lung disease that occurs in an estimated 800,000 beryllium-exposed workers in the United Sates. CBD is characterized by the presence of pulmonary non-caseating granulomas with accumulation of macrophages and beryllium specific CD4+ T cells (Newman et al. 1998). Upon beryllium stimulation in vitro, beryllium specific CD4+ T cells proliferate and produce Th1 cytokines (i.e. TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) at unusually high levels (Tinkle et al. 1997). The molecular mechanism(s) by which beryllium regulates the chronic production of these cytokines is unknown. Exciting preliminary studies indicate that beryllium alters the redox status of T cells which may adversely modulate the immune response in CBD. Based on these points, a novel hypothesis is proposed: 1) oxidative stress enhances the T cells response to antigen and this enhancement may explain both the excessive cytokine response and the pathogenesis of pulmonary granulomas in CBD and; 2) an inherent difference in T cell antioxidant status is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of CBD. This proposal is a pilot clinical trial examining an approved drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (5-amino salicylic acid, 5-ASA), which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as a potential new approach for CBD treatment. In this clinical trial, 40 CBD subjects already treated with prednisone, will be treated with either placebo or 5-ASA to determine it effects on the beryllium stimulated immune response in the lung by undergoing bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and in blood by undergoing venipuncture before and after 6 weeks of treatment with 5-ASA. As a secondary outcome, we will also assess subjects clinical response to this short course of 5-ASA using spirometry. Bronchoscopies are optional.

BS is a rare genetically-determined disorder described in NYC in 1954. The clinical courses of the 169 persons diagnosed BS by 1991 are followed in a program referred to as the Bloom's Syndrome Registry. BS is the prototype of the &quot;chromosome-breakage syndromes.&quot; BS cells mutate at a greater rate than any other, and the consequence is the greatest known predisposition to cancers of the types that affect the general human population. We are defining the clinical syndrome and at the same time are studying cells from affected families in the experimental laboratory. BS is a model for learning about cancer. Our contact with families lets us know of cancers arising, but blood, and sometimes tiny biopsies of skin, is taken if available so that (a) the chromosomes can be studied and (b) the gene mutations can be defined in molecular terms.","Biological Significance of the Bloom's Syndrome Protein",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Bloom Syndrome","D000007154","Immune System Diseases","Rare","Rare Diseases","Bloom's Syndrome","T785","Bloom Syndrome","high","D000013577","Syndrome",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Defined Population",-,"Other",-,"Although an occasional person with BS will be admitted to the hospital for special study (endocrine evaluation mainly)--two in the last 25 years--the Registry does not develop a doctor/patient relationship with affected persons.

Guided growth by 8 plate hemiepiphysiodesis is commonly used to correct coronal plane deformity around the knee. Since its introduction by Stevens in 2007 many studies have demonstrated the efficacy, safety and advantages of tension band plating in the paediatric age group as an alternative to corrective osteotomy.

Given the success and safety of riboflavin crosslinking, the investigators believe that it can increase the corneal stability in patients affected these disseases, preventing perforation. It is furthermore possible, that riboflavin crosslinking will allow corneal transplants to successfully be performed on blind eyes that have already perforated and opacified.

Survival rate of invasive candidiasis is associated with early initiation of antifungal therapy (15% mortality rate for candidemic patients with antifungal therapy on day 0 related to the culture date of the first blood sample positive for yeasts compared to 41% for patients who received antifungal therapy on day 3). Up to date, no laboratory method or clinical decision rule is available for correct anticipation of invasive candidiasis which would avoid delays in appropriate antifungal therapy initiation. In clinical practice culture based methods (e.g. blood cultures) miss up to 50% of invasive candidiasis cases. Preemptive antifungal therapy is therefore often initiated in critically ill patients after Candida has been isolated from various non-sterile patient samples even without any sufficient evidence for invasive candidiasis. The disadvantages of this approach include over- and undertreatment of patients (up to 50% of candidemia cases are missed, and on the other hand 89% patients are treated unnecessarily), increased selective pressure for the development of antifungal resistance, potential risk of adverse drug reactions, and increased costs (expenses for antifungal therapy account for half of the antimicrobial medication budget in tertiary care hospitals).

Severe edema results from leakage of fluid and macromolecules (200-900 kDa) into tissues. Acute SCLS episodes carry a high morbidity and mortality (25-30%). Fewer than 500 cases have been reported worldwide since 1960, although the disease may be underdiagnosed due to the nonspecific nature of the presenting signs and symptoms and the considerable overlap with other shock syndromes including sepsis, anaphylaxis, and angioedema. Approximately 85% of such individuals have a monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), but the relationship of this finding to disease pathogenesis is unclear. This protocol will focus on the pathogenesis of SCLS. Subjects with documented episodes of capillary leak will be evaluated in order to correlate both clinical and laboratory features that are typical of SCLS.

PPNAD can be associated with a variety of other manifestations, such as myxomas of the skin, heart, breast and other sites, psammomatous melanotic swannomas involving the peripheral nervous system (PNS), lentigines and blue nevi of the skin and mucosae, growth hormone (GH)-producing adenomas of the pituitary, testicular Sertoli cell tumors, and possibly other neoplasms (adrenocortical and thyroid follicular carcinoma, and ovarian cysts). These associations constitute a distinct clinical syndrome, Carney complex, a genetic syndrome. At present, there are no standardized screening tests for the members of families with affected individuals and the molecular mechanism(s) of this hereditary single and/or multiple neoplasia syndrome have not been completely elucidated (e.g. patients who meet clinical criteria for Carney complex but test negative for PRKAR1A mutation . This study seeks to define the genetic basis of PPNAD and/or Carney complex in sporadic and familial cases and the molecular pathogenesis of their tumors, to identify the carriers of the familial forms of the disease, and to determine the prognosis for carriers and affected individuals. The methods include standard clinical testing for endocrine and nonendocrine pathologic conditions of the subjects of the study, linkage analysis with DNA markers from areas of the genome likely to harbor the responsible gene(s), and finally genetic screening of these genes. Molecular studies of the tumors of the patients will provide additional clues for the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to PPNAD/Carney complex.

Compression of the intrathoracic structures results in pulmonary and left ventricular (LV) hypoplasia and abnormal development of the pulmonary vasculature in utero. These abnormalities in the development of the heart and lungs in utero, result in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and respiratory insufficiency after birth. Respiratory insufficiency is managed with intubation and mechanical ventilation. In addition to managing respiratory insufficiency, intubation prevents entrainment of air into the intestines and further compression of the lungs and heart. As part of routine resuscitation in infants with CDH intubation is performed after the delivery personnel separates the baby from the placenta by cutting the umbilical cord. Resuscitation of infants with CDH also involves placement of a nasogastric tube (NG) into the stomach for removal of entrained air and secretions as well as placement of catheters in the umbilical artery and vein for administration of medications (vein) and continuous blood pressure monitoring and sampling of blood (artery). As part of routine practice at our institution, these initial steps of resuscitation are all performed in parallel such that while one team is intubating and initiating ventilation as well as placing the NG tube, another team is placing umbilical lines. This approach has allowed the investigators to obtain arterial blood gas samples in 20 infants with CDH at a median of 4 minutes of life (range 2-9 minutes). When compared to cord blood arterial samples, pCO2 increases by a median of 35mmHg (range 11-77mmHg) from a median cord ABG pCO2 of 55mmHg (range 28-78 mmHg) to 88mmHg (range 65-123 mmHg). In addition to these changes in pCO2 median base deficit changed from -2 ± 0.5350 in the arterial cord blood sample to -7.994 ± 0.8547 in the umbilical arterial blood sample. The resultant respiratory and metabolic acidosis decreased the pH from 7.289 ± 0.01946 in the arterial cord blood sample to 7.036 ± 0.02051 after birth. In addition to the above measures, as part of routine resuscitation, the investigators routinely obtain echocardiographic studies in the first hour of life, to guide pulmonary hypertension management. These studies demonstrate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and right to left shunting at the ductus arteriosus about 50% of the time. The investigators speculate that the LV dysfunction and increased pulmonary vascular resistance are at least in part due to the acidemia described above. In addition, decreased preload to the LV from right to left shunting at the ductus arteriosus also likely contributes to LV dysfunction.

Because of the premature closure, the brain is not able to grow in its natural shape; instead, there is growth in areas of the skull where the joints have not yet closed. In CFNS, it results in malformation of the skull and face.

To date, neurological defects, as tethered cord and/or lipoma of the filum or the conus, are up lighted to be as a fourth major clinical sign.In half of cases, CS is ascribed to heterozygous mutations of the HLXB9 gene (or MNX1 gene, OMIM 142994) located at 7q36, with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The HLXB9 gene is involved in motoneurons and caudal development of the embryo. However, genetic heterogeneity is suspected, since patients without HLXB9 mutation harbour subtle phenotypic variations. Presently, no other locus has been identified. The pre-sacral tumor develops in almost 80% of CS. When it is a teratoma (30% of cases), it may turn into malignancy in 1 to 4 % of cases, according to literature. As far as we know, no clinical, molecular or pathological marker is operational to predict tumoral evolution and give any prognosis. Major aim of this study is to find out any correlation between clinical signs, constitutional and somatic genetic anomalies of HLXB9 gene and other candidate genes, and/or pathological features and tumoral evolution in CS. Evaluation of the pre-sacral tumor evolution is based on local recurrence or distance metastasis after surgical removal. Annual serum alpha-foeto-protein level monitoring is also performed, as the unique marker of teratoma.This study specifically required annual clinical examination and lumbar-sacral MRI imaging, three blood samples at inclusion and an annual blood sample.This multicentric study will last for at least 6 years. Eighty patients will be included and follow up for at least 3 years. Finally, this study may help identify a group of at-risk patients for tumor development and malignant transformation if pre-sacral teratoma. It will also help define objective clinical, radiological, molecular, pathological and/or biological criteria for long lasting survey. In general, it may also contribute to support hypothesis of close relationships between genes involve in oncogenesis and those involve in embryological development.",-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","57","Actual",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Prognosis factors",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"July 26, 2012","Estimate","July 25, 2012","OTHER","Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris",-,"Paris",-,-,-,-,-,"France","Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades Pediatric Surgery Department",-,-,"75015",-,-,"NCT00780117",-,"Characterization of At-risk Population and Prognosis Factors for SACRO-coccygeal Teratoma in CURRARINO Syndrome.

Despite the strong association between vocabulary knowledge and academic success, vocabulary is an under-recognized area of deficit in school-age children with DLD.

Additionally, the rate of vocabulary growth in children with DLD decreases compared to typically developing peers around age 10 and semantic representations of known vocabulary items are sparse. Even with this knowledge, the field's ability to make progress toward improved semantic learning in school age DLD is hindered by the lack of basic information on the underlying nature of the semantic learning deficits in this population.

The lissencephaly spectrum (including lissencephaly, pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia) is a well-defined group of MCD with a strong monogenetic basis. Using current molecular techniques, a causative variant is detected in approximately 80% of individuals with lissencephaly. In a routine diagnostic setting, exome-based gene panels are most frequently used while whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) are increasingly being implemented. Both techniques have their shortcomings including the detection of small copy number variants, the identification of pathogenic variants in non-coding regions as well as variant interpretation. The parallel use of quantitative RNA sequencing, measuring differences in RNA expression could be a possible solution for these shortcomings. The proposed research project will for the first time 1) evaluate the added value of WES/WGS combined with quantitative RNA sequencing for the identification of novel genes in individuals with lissencephaly, 2) identify the optimal sampling tissue for RNA sequencing in complex neurological phenotypes and 3) use RNA expression data to provide an evidence base for the current lissencephaly classification.","Combining Exome and Transcriptome Data to Unravel the Genetic Basis of the Lissencephalies","katrien.stouffs@uzbrussel.be","Katrien STOUFFS, Prof Dr","+32476328726",-,"Contact","UNKNOWN","Marguerite - Marie Delacroix Foundation","September 2025","Anticipated","Classical Lissencephalies and Subcortical Band Heterotopias","D000030342","Genetic Diseases, Inborn","Rare","Rare Diseases","Classical Lissencephalies","T3481","Lissencephaly 1","high","D000054221","Classical Lissencephalies and Subcortical Band Heterotopias",-,"Non-Randomized","Parallel Assignment","Diagnostic track: apply rna sequencing on lissencephaly patients without genetic diagnosis to establish d","None (Open Label)",-,-,"Diagnostic",-,-,"As mentioned before, lissencephalies have a strong monogenetic base in contrast to other brain malformations.

In the early days after the cloning of the dysferlin gene, several papers described the clinical phenotype over time of collections of patients leading to the recognition of the &quot;core&quot; phenotypes of Miyoshi Myopathy (MM), LGMD2B and the rarer distal myopathy with anterior tibial involvement. Most of these papers dealt with inbred populations with a limited number of mutations represented. Subsequent studies have reported larger numbers of patients with outbred mutations and extended the clinical spectrum to include onset as young as early childhood and as late as old age, with a large group of patients in whom a clear distinction in their pattern of muscle involvement into Miyoshi or LGMD was not possible, with involvement of both the proximal and distal musculature in most patients, especially as the disease progresses. A limitation of all of these studies however is that with few exceptions, again mainly in inbred groups, long-term follow-up data are not presented and data on clinical progression are collected in different ways making precise comparisons between their conclusions difficult. Nonetheless, the studies overall are in agreement that dysferlinopathy is a chronically progressive condition sometimes with periods where there is a plateauing of muscle function, with variable age at wheelchair dependency and probably a low risk of cardiac and respiratory complications compared to other types of muscular dystrophy. Intriguing suggestions from these publications which require more systematic study include the definition of a particularly good level of sporting prowess before the onset of symptoms and the description of a subacute onset with muscle pain and swelling, both features, if better understood, that potentially could help in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the ",-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","200","Anticipated",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Muscular Dystrophy",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"May 12, 2022","Actual","May 6, 2022","OTHER","Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust",-,"Newcastle upon Tyne","Georgina.Boyle@ncl.ac.uk","Georgina Boyle","241 8941","#4","Contact","United Kingdom","Institute of Translational and Clinical Research, Newcastle University, International Centre for Life","Tokyo","Recruiting","NE1 3BZ",-,"10 Years","NCT01676077",-,"International Clinical Outcome Study for Dysferlinopathy","OTHER","Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust","85750",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Newcastle University","Meredith K James","Principal Investigator","Recruiting","Yes",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"March 2024","Anticipated",-,-,-,"Moore UR, Jacobs M, Fernandez-Torron R, Jang J, James MK, Mayhew A, Rufibach L, Mittal P, Eagle M, Cnaan A, Carlier PG, Blamire A, Hilsden H, Lochmüller H, Grieben U, Spuler S, Tesi Rocha C, Day JW, Jones KJ, Bharucha-Goebel DX, Salort-Campana E, Harms M, Pestronk A, Krause S, Schreiber-Katz O, Walter MC, Paradas C, Hogrel JY, Stojkovic T, Takeda S, Mori-Yoshimura M, Bravver E, Sparks S, Diaz-Manera J, Bello L, Semplicini C, Pegoraro E, Mendell JR, Bushby K, Straub V.

The spectrum of molecular abnormalities is broad, leading to several subtypes of coagulation disorders with specific biological and clinical features. The correlation between the genotype and the phenotype is poor, and the clinical course of patients, from major bleeding to recurrent thromboses, is unpredictable. Fibrin clot structure is a determinant of the risk of thrombosis in cardiovascular diseases. In all individuals, fibrin networks define the propensity of clot to be more resistant to removal or, on the contrary, susceptible to fragmentation leading to bleeding complications. Besides fibrinogen variants, other relatively common genetic polymorphisms in coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways may affect the fibrin clot structure and therefore act as modifiers of the blood clot f","Genomics of Fibrin Clot Structure in Patients With Constitutional Dysfibrinogenemia","promo_interne_drci@chu-clermontferrand.fr","Lise Laclautre","334.73.754.963",-,"Contact",-,-,"June 2024","Anticipated","Hereditary Dysfibrinogenemia",-,-,"All","All Conditions","Dysfibrinogenemia","T1974","Dysfibrinogenemia","high",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Cohort",-,"Cross-Sectional",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","50","Anticipated",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Patients with hereditary dysfibrinogenemia","Ot","Other Dietary Supplements",-,"T382","Citrate","low","For each patient included, this study will involve the collection of 20 ml of blood during a blood test carried out as part of routine care.

The incidence of ventriculostomy-related cerebrospinal fluid infections had been quoted as between 2.2% to 10.4% in the more recent literature. Previous prospective studies in the investigators' unit have shown that the use of dual antibiotics prophylaxis in patients with external ventricular drain was associated with decreased incidence of CSF infection but was complicated with opportunistic extracranial infections. The current practice is to cover with prophylactic dual antibiotics unless guided by microbiology results for all patients with external ventricular drain.

Among them, disorders affecting skeletal and/or cardiac muscles are the most frequent clinical manifestations, with cardiac disease being a major cause of death. Remarkable progress has been made in the description of the clinical and genetic spectrum of these diseases since the 1990's. Until now, precise phenotype/genotype relations remain elusive. As for several other neuromuscular disorders, apart from symptomatic treatments, there is currently no specific treatment to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease.

Likewise, patients who have undergone bladder neck reconstruction but continue to have urinary incontinence (Group 2) are also faced with limited options. Often, both groups are considered for augmentation cystoplasty with closure of the bladder neck requiring intermittent catheter voiding through a surgically constructed continent catheterizable channel. Such major reconstruction has significant associated short and long-term morbidities. Endoscopic injection of MDCs for the treatment of urinary sphincter insufficiency is a potential alternative therapy for these patients. By increasing the outflow resistance and rhabdosphincter contractility, MDC injection may permit more efficient bladder cycling and bladder expansion in Group 1 patients allowing them to proceed on to bladder neck reconstruction.

The underlying pathology of anal stenosis results from a wide variety of either functional or anatomical causes . In functional anal stenosis, the presence of a hypertonic internal anal sphincter is the major cause of the narrowing, whereas in anatomical anal stenosis, the normal elastic anoderm replaced by an inelastic rigid fibrous tissue is the major cause of the anal canal narrowing(2). The best way of treatment of anal stenosis is avoiding its occurrence, as the major cause is following surgical hemorrhoidectomy, particularly when a large area of anoderm lining the anal canal is removed during the operation, but can also complicates other anorectal surgical operations(3). The patient usually experiences painful defecation, incomplete evacuation, pellet stool, or rectal bleeding. These manifestations force the patient to rely on daily laxatives or enemas in bowel evacuation(1). Usually physical examination is all that is needed to confirm the diagnosis of anal stenosis, including inspection of the anal canal, perianal skin, and digital rectal examination]. Anatomical anal stenosis can be classified according to Milsom and Mazie (4) based on the severity of the anal canal narrowing into mild anal stenosis, when the anal canal can be examined by a well-lubricated index finger or a medium-sized Hill-Ferguson retractor; moderate anal stenosis, when forceful dilatation is required to insert either the index finger or a medium-sized Hill-Ferguson retractor; and severe anal stenosis, when neither the little finger nor a small-sized Hill-Ferguson retractor can be i",-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","52","Anticipated",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","Accepts Healthy Volunteers",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Diamond flap versus V-Y flap",-,-,"anoplasty in treatment of post hemorroidectomy anal stenosis",-,"Procedure","No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"May 25, 2022","Actual","May 20, 2022","OTHER","Assiut University",-,"Assiut","Moamen.shalkamy@aun.edu.eg","Momen Shalqamy, PhD","01017520093",-,"Contact","Egypt","Assiut university",-,-,"17777","80 Years","20 Years","NCT05389475",-,"Anoplasty for Post Hemorroidectomy Anal Stenosis : Diamond Versus V-Y Flap Techniques","OTHER","Assiut University","Diamond flap",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Assiut University","Gamal Abdelhamid, PhD","Study Director","Not yet recruiting",-,"No",-,-,-,-,-,-,"July 1, 2024","Anticipated","Postoperative complication as anal pain , bleeding , infection , healing , incontinence","comparison between outcomes of Diamond flap versus V-Y flap in treatment of anal stenosis post hemorroidectomy","3 months","1 Liberman H, Thorson AG.

Compression of the intrathoracic structures results in pulmonary and left ventricular (LV) hypoplasia and abnormal development of the pulmonary vasculature in utero. These abnormalities in the development of the heart and lungs in utero, result in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and respiratory insufficiency after birth. Respiratory insufficiency is managed with intubation and mechanical ventilation. In addition to managing respiratory insufficiency, intubation prevents entrainment of air into the intestines and further compression of the lungs and heart. As part of routine resuscitation in infants with CDH intubation is performed after the delivery personnel separates the baby from the placenta by cutting the umbilical cord. Resuscitation of infants with CDH also involves placement of a nasogastric tube (NG) into the stomach for removal of entrained air and secretions as well as placement of catheters in the umbilical artery and vein for administration of medications (vein) and continuous blood pressure monitoring and sampling of blood (artery). As part of routine practice at our institution, these initial steps of resuscitation are all performed in parallel such that while one team is intubating and initiating ventilation as well as placing the NG tube, another team is placing umbilical lines. This approach has allowed the investigators to obtain arterial blood gas samples in 20 infants with CDH at a median of 4 minutes of life (range 2-9 minutes). When compared to cord blood arterial samples, pCO2 increases by a median of 35mmHg (range 11-77mmHg) from a median cord ABG pCO2 of 55mmHg (range 28-78 mmHg) to 88mmHg (range 65-123 mmHg). In addition to these changes in pCO2 median base deficit changed from -2 ± 0.5350 in the arterial cord blood sample to -7.994 ± 0.8547 in the umbilical arterial blood sample. The resultant respiratory and metabolic acidosis decreased the pH from 7.289 ± 0.01946 in the arterial cord blood sample to 7.036 ± 0.02051 after birth. In addition to the above measures, as part of routine resuscitation, the investigators routinely obtain echocardiographic studies in the first hour of life, to guide pulmonary hypertension management. These studies demonstrate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and right to left shunting at the ductus arteriosus about 50% of the time. The investigators speculate that the LV dysfunction and increased pulmonary vascular resistance are at least in part due to the acidemia described above. In addition, decreased preload to the LV from right to left shunting at the ductus arteriosus also likely contributes to LV dysfunction.

Rods and cones largely depend on the retinal pigment epithelium for their proper functioning. Various growth factors and their receptors are present in retinal epithelium and a number of genes are responsible for the production of these growth factors. Genetic mutation in any of these genes causes retinal degeneration by progressive loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. The disease initially starts with night blindness and leads to the loss of central vision and eventually total blindness. To date, there is no definitive cure for patients suffering from RP. Recently, stem cell based therapies have shown great promise for the management of RP. It is well documented that umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) have the ability to release various paracrine and immunomodulatory factors that are similar to those synthesized by retinal pigment epithelium. Multiple routes including systemic (intravenous) and localized (subretinal, intravitreal, suprachoroidal and sub-tenon) have been employed to administer UMSCs for the management of RP. It is important to note that deep sub-tenon region (space between the sclera and the conjunctiva) acts as both natural culture medium for cells and as immune privileged site because of avascularity of the region. It has been reported that the injection of UMSCs in sub-tenon space of human subjects have improved the visual acuity even after 1 year post-injection. In addition, the injection of UMSCs in suprachoroidal space enhances the entry of growth factors released by the cells into choroidal flow and maintain the constant growth factors secretion to the choroidal and retinal tissues. Limoli and colleagues were the first to report the suprachoroidal administration of cells being the safe mode of cell delivery with no complications. The present study is aimed to investigate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of UMSC injection employing two different routes (sub-tenon injection versus suprachoroidal injection) for the treatment of RP in human subjects.","Investigation of Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of UMSCs for the Management of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)","riazuddin@aimrc.org","Muhammad Ali, PhD","+923218429448",-,"Contact","UNKNOWN","Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB), University of the Punjab, Lahore.","June 2022","Anticipated","Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)","D000030342","Genetic Diseases, Inborn","Rare","Rare Diseases","Retinitis Pigmentosa","T4945","Retinitis Pigmentosa","high","D000012174","Retinitis Pigmentosa",-,"Randomized","Parallel Assignment","Group 1: Five (5) subjects will be treated by injecting UMSCs in sub-tenon space","None (Open Label)",-,-,"Treatment",-,-,"Isolation and characterization of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs): The culturing and characterization of UMSCs will be performed as documented by Ali and colleagues.

The umbilical cord tissue will be transported in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing penicillin and streptomycin on ice. In the biosafety cabinet, the cord will be washed with 4-5 changes of sterile 1x PBS and placed in a Petri plate with 15ml PBS. The cord will then gently scrap with a surgical blade to remove any dead cells. A 9 cm umbilical cord will be cut into three equal pieces and wash thoroughly to remove blood clots, umbilical cord arteries, and veins. Segments will be washed three times with PBS and minced. The minced pieces will be incubated in 17.5ml of collagenase solution (201 U/ml collagenase type I in serum-free DMEM-HG) in a 50ml conical tube for ~3 hrs in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37oC.

Compression of the intrathoracic structures results in pulmonary and left ventricular (LV) hypoplasia and abnormal development of the pulmonary vasculature in utero. These abnormalities in the development of the heart and lungs in utero, result in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and respiratory insufficiency after birth. Respiratory insufficiency is managed with intubation and mechanical ventilation. In addition to managing respiratory insufficiency, intubation prevents entrainment of air into the intestines and further compression of the lungs and heart. As part of routine resuscitation in infants with CDH intubation is performed after the delivery personnel separates the baby from the placenta by cutting the umbilical cord. Resuscitation of infants with CDH also involves placement of a nasogastric tube (NG) into the stomach for removal of entrained air and secretions as well as placement of catheters in the umbilical artery and vein for administration of medications (vein) and continuous blood pressure monitoring and sampling of blood (artery). As part of routine practice at our institution, these initial steps of resuscitation are all performed in parallel such that while one team is intubating and initiating ventilation as well as placing the NG tube, another team is placing umbilical lines. This approach has allowed the investigators to obtain arterial blood gas samples in 20 infants with CDH at a median of 4 minutes of life (range 2-9 minutes). When compared to cord blood arterial samples, pCO2 increases by a median of 35mmHg (range 11-77mmHg) from a median cord ABG pCO2 of 55mmHg (range 28-78 mmHg) to 88mmHg (range 65-123 mmHg). In addition to these changes in pCO2 median base deficit changed from -2 ± 0.5350 in the arterial cord blood sample to -7.994 ± 0.8547 in the umbilical arterial blood sample. The resultant respiratory and metabolic acidosis decreased the pH from 7.289 ± 0.01946 in the arterial cord blood sample to 7.036 ± 0.02051 after birth. In addition to the above measures, as part of routine resuscitation, the investigators routinely obtain echocardiographic studies in the first hour of life, to guide pulmonary hypertension management. These studies demonstrate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and right to left shunting at the ductus arteriosus about 50% of the time. The investigators speculate that the LV dysfunction and increased pulmonary vascular resistance are at least in part due to the acidemia described above. In addition, decreased preload to the LV from right to left shunting at the ductus arteriosus also likely contributes to LV dysfunction.

They secret various peptides and cause various symptoms (carcinoid syndrome) or not. The incidence of NETs was not well-known till recently when Yao et al. and Hausa et al. published their surveys of NETs using data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and from the Norwegian Registry of Cancer (NRC). The incidence of NETs in Taiwan by using the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) data was increased from 0.3 to 1.51 per 100,000 from 1996 to 2008. The increased incidence for NET worldwide probably was partially due to the awareness and improvement of diagnostic technology. Compared with the incidence in western countries, the incidence of NET is much lower in Taiwan. And the incidence of NETs in Asian Pacific Islanders was also lower than the whites and blacks in US. Gastroenteral-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs), accounting for half to two thirds of all NETs, is the most common site of NETs. As the progress in the understanding of pathophysiology for GEP-NET, there are two novel targeted agents shown to be effective for the treatment of GEP-NET. Meanwhile, response to mTOR inhibitor was better for Asian than Caucasian in the phase III study using everolimus for advanced pancreatic NETs. These information suggests that there is racial difference for either genetic or environmental risk factors and these factors result in different incidence and/or clinical outcome. Currently, there is limited data for thorough epidemiologic study in Taiwan. The aim of this study is to collect clinical information for GEP-NET, and survey the prognostic factors for GEP-NET in Taiwan. We suppose that this epidemiologic study would provide a database potentially to improve the diagnosis, and treatment of GEP-NET. This study plans to include 600 GEP-NET patients.

Correlational data indicate that exposure to air pollution increases inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use in asthmatics, suggesting that steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are suboptimally effective under these conditions. However, a major issue is that no study has yet been performed specifically to determine the effects of controlled diesel exhaust (DE) exposure on responses to ICS.

Patients with GPS bleed longer than other people because their platelets lack some of these protein-carrying sacs. Platelets without sacs look pale gray under the microscope rather than pink, giving the syndrome its name.

No gold standard currently exists and the definitive diagnosis is mainly based on the detection of heparin-dependent platelet-activating antibodies by ELISA method, on the platelet serotonin release assay (SRA) and on the changes of the blood platelet count after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. As a result, no early definitive diagnosis could be done. This could expose patients to thrombotic complications related to the HIT or hemorrhagic complications related to the alternative anticoagulant prescribed. This complications can threaten the prognosis of these patients. Particle gel immunoassay and automated immunoassay has been proposed for the early diagnosis of HIT in medical critically ill and non-critically ill patients. Many authors suggest that the accuracy of these immunological methods for the diagnosis of HIT could be altered in surgical patients, but these tests has never been specifically evaluated in this population.

This has hindered the development of methods for better understanding mechanisms. The development of better adapted tools to improve understanding and assessment of this substrate is crucial. The current electrophysiological study preceding the ablation is exclusively based on substrate depolarisation potential. It is very powerful when the arrhythmia is organized but limited during fibrillation due to incessant changes in activation. Therefore, potentials of repolarization are better suited for the explorations of fibrillations because they provide basic properties such as refractory period and tissue heterogeneity in arrhythmia, but also in sinus rhythm. Monophasic Action Potential catheters (MAP EFA Boston and MAP Biosense Webster) are available for many years and represent a very useful tool in cardiology in identifying critical areas to arrhythmias (mapping of depolarization and cardiac repolarization). However, their capacity to record action potential is limited because they have one electrode that allows &quot;point-to-point&quot; mapping by moving the catheter sequentially in the cardiac cavities. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain one action potential due to the configuration or the angle of contact of the catheter with the cardiac wall. We want to evaluate a new MAP catheter (MAP4, Medtronic) to assess cardiac depolarization and repolarization. This catheter was developed to allow recording of an action potential whenever the catheter touches the heart wall and whatever the configuration or contact angle. It appears identical to other catheters but is equipped with 4 spherical microelectrodes at its end. Each microelectrode is arranged to one of the 4 'cardinal points' which allows easily simultaneous recording of 4 actions potential. Hundred and fifty patients will be included to explore mapping capabilities in cardiac chambers in patients suffering from regular or fibrillating tachycardia's with the following inclusion plan: i) Atrial fibrillation at a total of 50 patients ii) Ventricular fibrillation or patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death at a total of 50 patients iii) Junctional tachycardia at a total of 50 patients.

Urine protein markers can be identified by &quot;proteomic&quot; analyses in which proteins are processed in a lab to break them down into smaller building blocks. Using analytical chemistry techniques and specialized equipment many proteins can be identified and measured. Most proteins are found in healthy living cells while subtle changes in these proteins or the presence of different markers reflect abnormal processes and patterns of disease. When identified in disease, protein biomarkers can help to determine if a disease responds to new types of therapies. In this study, changes in urine proteomic patterns over time, their association with change in estimated (calculated) kidney filtering function, and the relative risk for progression of PH1 will be determined. Additionally, as part of the study, the investigators will measure urinary proteins and peptides that are markers of kidney tissue protection (for healthy healing of the kidneys from ongoing damage from high urine oxalate levels, oxalate crystals and stones) to establish if and when these markers are prospectively decreased in PH1 urine. Longitudinal studies of urine &quot;proteomics&quot; may assist in identifying the mechanisms behind PH1-related progression of kidney failure and might contribute important information towards future identification and development of effective therapies to slow or prevent kidney failure in PH1.","Proteomics of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1",-,-,-,-,-,"NIH","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)","May 31, 2019","Actual","Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1","D000008659","Metabolic Diseases","Rare","Rare Diseases","Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1","T4693","Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1","high","D000006960","Hyperoxaluria, Primary",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Case-Control",-,"Other",-,"Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare genetically inherited disorder seen in 1:100,000-150,000 people and is often underdiagnosed in children.

Topical therapy with the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus has been demonstrated to improve the skin integrity and the quality of life of patients with several chronic dermatoses, including atopic dermatitis. As a result of the underlying skin barrier dysfunction, however, the possibility of significant systemic absorption and resultant side effects is a concern when these agents are used in patients with Netherton syndrome. Experience with topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment for patients with Netherton syndrome has demonstrated both marked efficacy as well as significant systemic absorption of the drug in this patient population.

Mechanisms for this increased risk in women are not well-understood. QTc interval duration has been shown to fluctuate throughout the phases of the menstrual cycle. Evidence indicates that the QTc interval response to drugs that may cause TdP is greater during the menses and ovulation phases of the menstrual cycle, during which serum progesterone concentrations are lowest, and lesser during the luteal phase, during which serum progesterone concentrations are highest. Additional evidence from our laboratory suggests that progesterone may be protective against TdP. Specific Aim 1: Establish the influence of oral progesterone administration as a preventive method by which to diminish the degree of drug-induced QT interval prolongation in women. Working hypothesis: Oral progesterone administration effectively attenuates enhanced drug-induced QT interval response in women. To test this hypothesis, progesterone or placebo will be administered in a crossover fashion to women during the menses phase of the menstrual cycle. QTc interval response to low-dose ibutilide, a drug known to lengthen the QT interval, will be assessed. The primary endpoint will be individually-corrected QT interval (QTcI) response to ibutilide, in the presence and absence of progesterone, which will be assessed by: 1) Effect on maximum change in QTcI, and 2) Area under the QTcI interval-time curves (AUEC). At the conclusion of this study, we will have established that oral progesterone administration is a safe and effective method of attenuating drug-induced QT interval prolongation.","Influence of Progesterone Administration on Drug-Induced QT Interval Lengthening",-,-,-,-,-,"OTHER","American Heart Association","June 2014","Actual","Prolonged QT Interval in EKG and Sudden Death","D000000013","Congenital Abnormalities","Rare","Rare Diseases","Prolonged QT Interval in EKG and Sudden Death","T3144","Jervell Lange-Nielsen Syndrome","high","D000003645","Death, Sudden",-,"Randomized","Crossover Assignment",-,"Quadruple",-,-,"Prevention",-,"Outcomes Assessor",-,-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","19","Actual",-,-,"Subjects will receive oral placebo, two capsules once daily every evening fo","EG001","2","17","0","17","Placebo",-,"0","During 7 days of therapy with progesterone or placebo",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Number of patients randomized to receive progesterone first","FG001","1",-,-,"Adverse Event","Subjects will receive oral placebo, two capsules once daily every evening fo","FG001","Placebo First, Then Progesterone",-,"NOT COMPLETED","Intervention 2","n=333 subjects assessed for eligibility; n=27 consented, n=306 excluded (n=108 did not meet inclusion criteria, n=198 declined to participate); of n=27 consented, n=19 enrolled, n=8 excluded because they met one or more exclusion criteria",-,"FG001","1",-,"Subjects recruited from a) INResearch database, maintained by Indiana Clinical Translational Research Institute (CTSI), and b) Hard copy and electronic advertisements on the IUPUI and Purdue University campuses Participants were recruited between October 2012 and February 2014",-,"Female",-,-,"No","Accepts Healthy Volunteers",-,-,-,-,-,-,"D000000889","Anti-Arrhythmia Agents","Progesterone","AnArAg","Anti-Arrhythmia Agents","ROX","M3365","Anti-Arrhythmia Agents","low","Ibutilide 0.003 mg/kg administered to all subjects to moderately lengthen the QT interval","D000011374","Progesterone","Ibutilide",-,"Drug",-,-,-,-,-,"Electrocardiography",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"October 30, 2015","Estimate","October 29, 2015","OTHER","Indiana University",-,"Indianapolis",-,-,-,-,-,"United States","Purdue University","Indiana",-,"46202","40 Years","21 Years","NCT01929083",-,"Influence of Progesterone Administration on Drug-Induced QT Interval Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes","OTHER","Indiana University","12GRNT12060187",-,-,-,"Systematic Assessment",-,"General disorders",-,"EG001","0","17","0","Hypotension",-,"Ratio of Serum Progesterone:Estradiol Concentrations During the Progesterone and Placebo Phases","After 7 days of progesterone or placebo",-,-,"2-Sided",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"OG001",-,"Superiority or Other",-,"0.0001","p value for transient QTc interval &gt; 500 ms",-,-,"Paired t-test","t-test, 2 sided","No",-,-,-,-,"Transient QTc interval &gt; 500 ms","OG001","15","Participants","Subjects will receive oral placebo, two capsules once daily every evening fo","OG001","Placebo",-,-,-,"QT intervals will be corrected as follows: Prior to randomization, subjects will come to the Indiana Clinical Research Center for a 12-hour stay, during which three ECGs, one minute apart, will be obtained at the following times: 0, 15 &amp; 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours.

The latter mechanisms affects 1.7% of the general population, making glenohumeral instability the most frequent type of all joint instabilities.1 Shoulder apprehension is defined as anxiety and resistance in patients with a history of anterior glenohumeral instability. After an open or arthroscopic stabilization, 3% to 51% of patients will keep apprehension or will avoid any shoulder movement because of fear of dislocation.2,3 This can lead to increased morbidity for patients: increased pain, decreased activity level, prolonged absence from work and sports, and a general decrease in quality of life.4,5 Currently, the origin of persistent apprehension is unknown. Although a bony defect has been recognized as a major cause of residual instability,6 some patients remain apprehensive without any proven recurrence of dislocation and a clinically stable shoulder. Theoretically, such apprehension after glenohumeral stabilization could be related to (1) central nervous system sequelae subsequent to a learned negative stimulus,7,8, (2) peripheral neurological lesion consecutively to dislocation affecting proprioception,9 or (3) persistent mechanical instability consisting in micro-movements (i.e., postoperative form of unstable painful shoulder as described by Patte et",-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","11","Actual",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Shoulder Stabilization",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Open Latarjet was performed as the standard and well-described Latarjet-Patte procedure with subscapularis split and triple locking mechanism.14 The graft was intra-articular in every case, the capsule was systematically reattached to glenoid according to Favard's modification,15 and a capsular shift was added. Arthroscopic Latarjet was carried out in one case according to a modified Lafosse technique.16 In the latter treatment option, no reattachment of the capsule was realized. The arthroscopic Bankart repair consisted in a mobilization of the anteroinferior capsule and the labrum with an arthroscopic elevator.

They are associated with a severe metabolic syndrome especially when linked to the mutation of the R482 codon of the LMNA gene (Familial partial lipodystrophy type 2, FPL2). Data in lipodystrophy induced by antiretroviral therapy of HIV suggests an increase in the activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11bHSD1). This enzyme reactivates cortisone in cortisol in adipose tissues and liver and has associated to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hence, the hypothesis is that in patients suffering from FPL2 with the R482 codon mutation of the LMNA gene, there is an increase in the activity of HSD11B1 which could participate to the metabolic phenotype of the disease.","Study of Cortisol Metabolism in Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Type 2","stephanie.espiard@chru-lille.fr","Stéphanie ESPIARD, MD","0320445962","+33","Contact",-,-,"April 2024","Anticipated","Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Type 2","D000030342","Genetic Diseases, Inborn","Rare","Rare Diseases","Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Type 2","T2248","Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Type 2","high","D000008060","Lipodystrophy",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Cohort",-,"Prospective",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","90","Anticipated",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Patients with FPL2 genetically confirmed","Hypo","Hypoglycemic Agents",-,"M172956","Insulin, Globin Zinc","low","Biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue",-,-,"Biopsy",-,"Other","No","No",-,-,-,"Hypertriglyceridemia",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 27, 2022","Actual","June 20, 2022","OTHER","University Hospital, Lille",-,"Lille",-,-,-,-,-,"France","Hop Claude Huriez",-,"Recruiting","59037",-,"15 Years","NCT04845165",-,"Study of Cortisol Metabolism in Familial Partial Lipodystrophy Type 2","OTHER","University Hospital, Lille","2020_50",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"University Hospital, Lille","Stéphanie ESPIARD, MD","Principal Investigator","Recruiting","No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,"April 2024","Anticipated",-,"THE/(THF+αTHF) ratio measured in the 24h urine collections in patients","Baseline",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Sponsor",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Probability Sample","2020-A03167-32","ID-RCB number,ANSM",-,"Other Identifier",-,"Correlation of 11BHSD1 activity and metabolic parameters in patients","Baseline",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"April 19, 2022","Actual","March 2022","Older Adult","April 14, 2021","Actual","April 13, 2021","April 13, 2021","Patients suffering from FPL2 with the R482 codon mutation of the LMNA gene treated in the department of endocrinology at Lille University Hospital.","Observational",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 28, 2022",-

The long QT syndrome is caused by mutations of predominantly potassium and sodium ion channel genes or channel-related proteins. The most common types of LQTS affect: the slow delayed rectifier potassium repolarization channel (KCNQ1; LQT1) resulting in a reduction in IKs current; the rapid delayed rectifying potassium repolarization channel (KCNH2; LQT2) resulting in a reduction in IKr current; and the sodium channel (SCN5A; LQT3) resulting in an increase in late INa current. Among positively genotyped patients, LQT1 and LQT2 account for about 90% of LQTS cases, whereas LQT3 accounts for about 5% to 8% of cases. LQT3 patients represent a challenging cohort of patients. Unlike patients with LQT1 and LQT2 form of this disorder, the LQT3 patients have high lethality of cardiac events with 1 in 5 patients dying suddenly during their first syncopal or arrhythmic event. In childhood (age 0-18) in the analysis of 1,404 patients, LQT3 was found to be associated with significantly higher risk of aborted cardiac arrest or death than LQT1 and LQT2. A similar pattern is observed in LQTS patients after age 40 in whom LQT3 patients show the highest risk. Optimal therapy in LQT3 patients remains controversial. There are data showing that sodium current blockers including mexiletine and flecainide shorten QTc duration in LQT3 patients. Ranolazine is a selective late sodium current inhibitor that has been also showed to reduce QTc in DKPQ mutation and D1790G mutation patients.

Across 81 countries, approximately 120 million people are infected with the disease, and of those infected, an estimated 40% reside in India alone. The most disfiguring symptoms of lymphatic filariasis, elephantiasis and lymphedema, cause long-term suffering in patients who are then often embarrassed or even rejected from their communities. Because of the disease's debilitating physical and social effects on patients, this study will explore the intersection of disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in lymphatic filariasis patients in India. Specifically, HRQoL and disability in lymphatic filariasis subjects and age- and gender- matched control subjects will be compared. Two HRQoL tools , the general Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and a disease-specific instrument developed by a dermatology group in India will be used to gauge HRQol. In addition, the demographic and disease-specific factors associated with HRQoL and disability in filarial lymphedema subjects will be identified.","Disability and Quality of Life in Patients With Lymphatic Filariasis in Rural Southern India",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 2012","Actual","Lymphatic Filariasis","D000079426","Vector Borne Diseases","Rare","Rare Diseases","Lymphatic Filariasis","T2684","Helminthiasis","low","D000004604","Elephantiasis",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Case-Control",-,"Prospective",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Case Inclusion ","72","Actual",-,-,"Age- and gender-matched control subjects completed health-related quality of life questionnaires.","EG001","0","0","0","0","Control Subjects",-,"5",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"FG001","0",-,-,-,"Age- and gender-matched control subjects completed health-related quality of life questionnaires.","FG001","Control Subjects",-,"NOT COMPLETED","Overall Study",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","Accepts Healthy Volunteers",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"March 20, 2014","Estimate","February 24, 2014","OTHER","Northwestern University",-,"Kasaragod district",-,-,-,-,-,"India","Institute of Applied Dermatology","Kerala",-,"60611",-,"18 Years","NCT01629771",-,"Disability and Quality of Life in Patients With Lymphatic Filariasis in Rural Southern India","OTHER","Northwestern University","STU63944",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Participation in Society","OG001","36","Participants","Age- and gender-matched control subjects completed health-related quality of life questionnaires.","OG001","Control Subjects",-,-,-,"The WHODAS 2.0 is a generic health and disability assessment tool that describes effects of disease on six domains: Cognition, Mobility, Self-Care, Getting Along, Life Activities, and Participation in Society.

Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) is the most common chromosomal disorder, with a incidence of approximately 1 per 660-800 births. Patients with Down Syndrome have a higher incidence of OSA than the general pediatric population, with rates of 30-60%, resulting in increased morbidity and decreased quality of life for affected individuals. In children, adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A) is often a contributing factor to OSA, and adenotonsillectomy is a first line treatment. Children with Down Syndrome often undergo T&amp;A for obstructive sleep apnea, however 30-50% will have persistent obstructive sleep patterns requiring continuous positive pressure airway support (CPAP) or tracheotomy. Persistent obstruction is attributed to anatomic and physiologic differences in this population, including reduced muscular tone, macroglossia, maxillary hypoplasia, and lingual tonsil hypertrophy.

SS is characterized by advanced bone age, macrocephaly, characteristic facies and cognitive delay. For the latter aspect, recent studies has described impairments in specific neuropsychological domains and alterations of social behavior. However, this evidence has been gathered in small and non-uniform samples, thus requiring further investigation. Moreover, a description of the neuropsychological and behavioral profile of SS in developmental age is still lacking. BWS is presented with macroglossia, exomphalos, lateralized overgrowth and hyperinsulinism as cardinal features, and is often associated with Wilms tumor and pathologies of internal organs.

The main immunocompromised population affected by these infections consists of solid organ transplant recipients (SOT), mainly kidney (~70% of cases in immunocompromised patients). In this population, the infection is severe, and becomes chronic in the absence of appropriate care, the species Enterocytozoon bieneusi being found in more than 95% of these cases. Reducing immunosuppression (adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy) can sometimes be enough to eliminate the pathogen. However, in some cases, specific treatment is necessary. The only molecule whose efficacy has been proven to date to treat infections caused by E. bieneusi is fumagillin (FLISINT®), however its production has been stopped for almost 2 years. Due to the therapeutic impasse, the use of nitazoxanide (ALINIA®) to treat E. bieneusi microsporidiosis is becoming common, despite the lack of proof of its efficacy. It seems important and urgent to evaluate the relevance of the use of nitazoxanide, particularly in SOT, for the treatment of intestinal microsporidiosis due to E. bieneusi.","Interest of Nitazoxanide Treatment of Enterocytozoon Bieneusi Intestinal Microsporidiosis",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 1, 2022","Actual","Microsporidiosis Intestinal","D000007239","Infections","Rare","Rare Diseases","Microsporidiosis","T3810","Microsporidiosis","high","D000016881","Microsporidiosis",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Case-Only",-,"Retrospective",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Inclusion C","80","Actual",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All",-,-,"No","No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"All","All Drugs and Chemicals",-,"M340866","Nitazoxanide","low",-,-,-,-,-,-,"No","No",-,-,-,"solid organ transplant",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 14, 2022","Actual","June 9, 2022","OTHER","University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand",-,"Pointe-à-Pitre",-,-,-,-,-,"Guadeloupe","CHU Pointe-à-Pitre",-,-,"63000",-,"18 Years","NCT05417815",-,"Interest of Nitazoxanide Treatment of Enterocytozoon Bieneusi Intestinal Microsporidiosis","OTHER","University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand","2022 POIRIER NITAZO-SPORE",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand","Philippe Poirier","Study Director","Completed","No","No",-,-,-,-,-,-,"April 1, 2022","Actual","side effects during treatment: value of platelets, liver enzymes, occurrence of drug interactions","tolerance with side effects","1 year",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Sponsor",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Non-Probability Sample",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"April 1, 2022","Actual","May 2022","Older Adult","June 14, 2022","Actual","June 2, 2022","June 9, 2022","SOT with microsporidiosis","Observational",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 28, 2022",-

Outcome in patients with GBS has not improved in the last two decades. At present about 10 to 20% of patients remain severely disabled and about 5% die. One explanation for this stagnation is the highly variable clinical course of GBS and the lack of knowledge about the factors that determine the clinical course in individual patients with GBS. GBS may consist of distinct pathogenic subgroups, in which disease onset and progression is influenced by different types of preceding infections, anti-neural antibodies and genetic polymorphisms. Optimal treatment of individual patients may depend on the pathogenesis and clinical severity. Patients with severe forms of GBS may possibly need more intensive treatment to recover. Patients with a milder course that fully recover after standard therapy could suffer from possibly more side effects of more aggressive forms of treatment. This could only be possible if there are prognostic models that accurately predict the clinical course in individual patients. Ideally such models should be based on clinical and biological predictors that are strongly associated with disease course and known as early as possible in the acute phase of illness, when treatment with immunomodulatory therapy is most effective. Prognostic models could help to guide selective trials in specific GBS subtypes.

The main signs and symptoms are cough, bulging and purulent expectoration, digital clubbing, dyspnoea, and wheezing and wheezing accompanied by recurrent respiratory infection.

SCA1 is the fastest progressing SCA while SCA3 is the most common SCA in US and Europe. Expanded (CAG)n repeats encoding polyglutamines (polyQ) in the respective genes, Ataxin 1 (ATXN1) and Ataxin 3 (ATXN3), cause SCA1 and SCA3. Disease-modifying therapies that target the pathway upstream of the complex pathogenic cascade will offer ultimate treatment. Scientific premise and preclinical animal data strongly support MSK1 inhibitors for SCA1, citalopram for SCA3, and nucleotide-based gene silencing for both SCAs as drugs to be examined in clinical trials in five years. However, the challenge that investigators face in current clinical trial readiness for such disease-modifying therapies is that the modest effect size of candidate drugs as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA; the most robust and well-validated clinical outcome assessment measure) requires large cohorts of study subjects to achieve sufficient statistical power. To accomplish the goal of establishing clinical trial readiness, the investigators propose to launch an international, multi-site effort focusing on premanifest mutation carriers and patients in an early disease stage, who are likely responders to the disease-modifying interventions prior to irreversible brain damage. Based on the investigators' studies funded by NIH and the National Ataxia Foundation (NAF), the US ataxia consortium has developed an unprecedented opportunity for tight collaborations with the European Ataxia Study Group to jointly address this challenge and establish clinical trial readiness for SCA1 and SCA3.

The cause of pancreatic cancer is multifactorial. However, around 10% of cases are associated with hereditary predisposition. Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, CDKN2A, STK11, DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2), PALB2, FANCC, FANCG, and ATM have been associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. The prevalence of these germline mutations varies across populations. For instance, the prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in high-risk populations can be up to 20%. On the other hand, in unselected patient population, the prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutations is 5-7%. In Mexican population, data on the prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in patients with pancreatic cancer are lacking. Identification of BRCA germline mutations in patients with pancreatic cancer has implications for treatment. Also, it allows genetic testing and counselling for family members. This study will determine the prevalence of germline mutations associated with hereditary pancreatic cancer using a comprehensive gene panel in an unselected cohort of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in Mexico.","Germline Mutations Associated With Hereditary Pancreatic Cancer in Unselected Patients With Pancreatic Cancer in Mexico","dravanessarosascamargo@yahoo.com.mx","Vanessa Rosas Camargo, MD","525554870900","2254","Contact",-,-,"March 2022","Anticipated","Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma","D000004700","Endocrine System Diseases","Rare","Rare Diseases","Hereditary Pancreatic Cancer","T2243","Familial Pancreatic Cancer","high","D000010190","Pancreatic Neoplasms",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Cohort",-,"Prospective",-,"This is an observational study to estimate the prevalence of germline mutations in patients with pancreatic cancer.

Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding polyglutamine tracts. ADCA have a wide range of neurological symptoms including ataxia of gait, stance, and limbs, cerebellar dysarthria, oculomotor disturbances of cerebellar and supranuclear genesis, retinopathy, optic atrophy, spasticity, extra-pyramidal movement disorders, peripheral neuropathy, sphincter disturbances, cognitive impairment, and epilepsy. Corresponding to neuropathological findings in hereditary ataxia, there are three fundamental patterns of degeneration on MRI: spinal atrophy, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and cortical cerebellar atrophy. We previously showed an hypercatabolism in premanifest and early stage Huntington's disease (HD), along with a systemic metabolic defect: progressive decrease of the plasmatic branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) - correlated with low serum IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) - and muscle energy metabolism abnormalities measured by 31P-NMR spectroscopy. We also observed a weight loss in SCA1, 3 and mostly SCA7 patients. In addition, we underlined in a preliminary study a significant decrease of the BCAA in SCA1,2,3 and 7 patients, suggesting that an energy deficit would also be implied in SCA pathogenesis. Transcriptional interferences are likely a part of SCA physiopathology, as shown in the retinal cells of a SCA7 mouse model, or as we detected over the cerebellum growth of these mice. The hallmark of the gene expression studies in SCA1 and SCA7 mice points out the implication of IGF1 pathway and IGF1 receptor.

Our working hypothesis is that both topical cholesterol/lovastatin and lovastatin alone are helpful in treating patients with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP). Potential subjects will be approached by their care team member to be made aware of the study at MUSC Dermatology clinics. Subsequently, members of the study team will approach their own patients to ask for participation in this study. Pertinent project information, risks, and time commitment will be relayed to subjects. If subjects show interest in participating, they will be given consent forms to either sign or bring home for consideration. If the patient is eligible for the study, he or she will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. They will have a 50/50 chance of being in either group. You will not make the choice to which group you are assigned. The two groups are Group A (cholesterol/lovastatin) and Group B (lovastatin only). The patient will not be informed of which group they are in and will not be informed of what their study medication is, allowing single-blinding. Researchers will not be masked. Initial enrollment will occur virtually. Enrolled subjects will be followed up at monthly intervals for three months via virtual check-in. At each visit, participants will undergo brief physical examination; additionally, clinical photographs of the lesion will be obtained. Photographs will be stored in the electronic medical record and stored in a departmental secure drive for further analysis of lesion features. At each visit the novel DSAP- General Assessment Scale and RAND36 QoL scale will be administered. Patients will be contacted via virtual check-in visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Patients will be asked about compliance and any adverse effects experienced. Participants will also be contacted by phone by study team member to assess for any adverse effects at weeks 2 and 6 of treatment. Compounded topical medication prescribed to subjects will be self-applied twice daily. These medications will be prepared by Tide Water Pharmacy Charleston, SC and Chemistry RX Philadelphia, PA. Chemistry Rx will ship the medications to the patients. They will be prepared so the study will remain single-blinded. The associated costs will not be covered by the research budget. Dermoscopic and clinical photographs will be subsequently analyzed for the presence of cornoid lamella. The team will record any additional dermoscopic or clinicals feature that may arise during the analyses.

In many girls, PP takes a rapid course of progression (rapidly progressive precocious puberty; RP-PP) with an early menarche and fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates, leading eventually to a reduced final height if not treated. In a subset of girls with PP however, the growth rate slows to normal for age, skeletal maturation progresses in accordance with chronological age and there is little to no risk of impairment of final height (slowly progressive precocious puberty; SP-PP). Other conditions of non-progressive PP include premature breast budding and unsustained PP that is characterized by a spontaneous regression of sexual precocity.

In many girls, PP takes a rapid course of progression (rapidly progressive precocious puberty; RP-PP) with an early menarche and fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates, leading eventually to a reduced final height if not treated. In a subset of girls with PP however, the growth rate slows to normal for age, skeletal maturation progresses in accordance with chronological age and there is little to no risk of impairment of final height (slowly progressive precocious puberty; SP-PP). Other conditions of non-progressive PP include premature thelarche and unsustained PP that is characterized by a regression of sexual precocity.

It is characterized by headaches, tinnitus and visual loss, due to optic atrophy, in 50% of cases. Surgical treatments, such as CSF shunt placement and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF), are indicated in case of failure or non-compliance (owing to side effects) of medical treatments (that mainly includes weight loss and drugs, such as Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors). However, these surgical treatments are limited by relative high complications and recurrence rate. Indeed, improvement in visual function after ONSF is often transient and the risk of complications, including visual loss, pupillary dysfunction, and vascular complications is up to 40%. With no better treatment option, intraventricular or lumbar shunt placement has become the traditional treatment for medically refractory IIH, despite poor results. Indeed, series of patients with IIH treated with shunt replacement report a complications rate (shunt occlusion, disconnection, infection or intracranial hematoma formation) around 50% and a failure rate up to 64% within 6 months.

PLP is a coenzyme in several phases of one carbon (1C) metabolism, which is the array of reactions in which one carbon units are acquired and used in reactions including nucleotide synthesis, regeneration of methionine (Met) from homocysteine (Hcy), and methylation of many biological compounds. 1C metabolism is linked to the transsulfuration pathway in which Hcy undergoes PLP-dependent catabolism leading to cysteine, whose availability governs the formation of the antioxidant glutathione. Nutritional or genetic conditions that impair 1C metabolism are associated with elevation in plasma Hcy concentration and increased risk of vascular disease. It is believed that the metabolic effects of vitamin B6 deficiency will be most pronounced following protein intake when the vitamin B6-dependent pathways of amino acid metabolism experience the greatest substrate load. The human subjects protocols of this study consist of two distinct phases intended to extend our understanding of basic human 1C metabolism and the effects of marginal vitamin B6 deficiency under postprandial conditions. Phase 1 will investigate the effects of vitamin B6 nutrition on the PLP-dependent generation of 1C units by the glycine cleavage system and on the synthesis of glutathione. Phase 2 will investigate the dependence of methionine metabolism on vitamin B6 nutritional status, with particular emphasis on the recycling of Hcy to Met. Each phase of this study will involve 14 healthy, nutritionally adequate, young adults (7 male, 7 female) who will undergo metabolite profiling and kinetic analysis using intravenously infused stable isotopic tracers performed both before and after a ~4-week period of dietary vitamin B6 restriction. Subjects will be assigned to either Phase 1 or Phase 2, which will be identical in design except for the tracers and analytical methods used. We hypothesize that vitamin B6 deficiency will yield reduction in postprandial rates of homocysteine remethylation, generation of 1C units from glycine, and synthesis of glutathione. The results of this study will aid in assessing the consequences of nutritional and genetic variables affecting human metabolism and will further our understanding of the relationships between vitamin B6 nutrition and disease.","Vitamin B6 Dependence of One-Carbon Metabolism",-,-,-,-,-,"NIH","National Institutes of Health (NIH)","September 2010","Actual","Vitamin B6 Deficiency","D000009748","Nutrition Disorders","Rare","Rare Diseases","Vitamin B6 deficiency","T4845","Pyridoxine Deficiency","high","D000026681","Vitamin B 6 Deficiency",-,"Non-Randomized","Single Group Assignment",-,"None (Open Label)",-,-,"Diagnostic",-,-,"If you volunteer for this study, you will come to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at Shands Hospital for a screening visit.

The specific primary objectives of this study are to: 1. Investigate the relationship between genotype and phenotype in X-Linked Retinoschisis by correlating four phenotype severity classes with two classes of genotypes (refer to Section 7. for definitions). This is the first step in developing a comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation. 2. Characterize the anatomical and functional characteristics of retinoschisis to refine the phenotype scale and investigate and characterize specific XLRS1 mutations to generate a well-documented genotype-phenotype correlation map. With the opportunity to study the genotypes and phenotypes of many affected males and the genotype of family members, a secondary objective of this study will be to develop a detailed pedigree for affected families. This information may be used to develop preliminary risk estimates for potential carrier females. Study Population: Up to 500 participants may enroll in this study. A minimum of 150 of participants are expected to be males diagnosed with X-Linked Retinoschisis. Participants may be recruited from the NIH and also from participating off-site locations. The quality of the genetic observation is directly proportional to the number of affected individuals and genetically-different families enrolled. Design: This natural history, multi-center, registry study to enroll males diagnosed with X-Linked Retinoschisis and the family members of affected individuals. Onsite affected males will undergo clinical examination and have their blood drawn for genotyping. Onsite unaffected participants will undergo eye examinations. Blood may also be drawn from the onsite unaffected participants but this is not required. Sites outside of NIH are participating as referral centers to accumulate the cohort. Offsite affected male participants will forward a blood sample and records from previous eye examinations to the NEI for review and analysis. Offsite unaffected participants will forward records from previous eye examinations and may provide a blood sample although this is not required.

In particular, ulcers are caused by narrowing of the arteries, resulting in reduced blood supply to the fingers, causing pain and difficult to heal leaving deep scars. DEs may be present on the rails or fingertips, on the extensor surfaces of the joints, and depending on the underlying calcification. The etiology of ulcers is multifactorial. Raynaud's ischemia, sclerosis, dry skin, calcification and local trauma can all contribute to the onset of Digital Ulcers. Spontaneous fissures or ruptures can also develop into ulcers in patients with scleroderma and severe Raynaud's disease. Whatever the reason for their appearance, DEs negatively affect the quality of life of patients as they complicate even simple daily activities, while they can lead to serious complications such as osteomyelitis or other serious soft tissue infections, up to amputation. Over the last decade, in several randomized clinical trials, DEs have been studied in detail, which are defined or classified differently in each case. The clinical treatment of patients with DE would be facilitated by the availability of specific criteria for the classification of DE. Internationally, the classification of pressure ulcers is usually followed, but this classification is not sufficient for all types of DE observed in Scleroderma. The lack of a clear classification of DEs prompted researchers to evaluate the frequency and morphology of lesions, their characteristics, their physical course, and their healing time in groups of patients with Scleroderma. In a recent study, three categories of classification of digital ulcers based on the patient's clinical picture were proposed by the UK Scleroderma Study Group (UKSSG).","Effectiveness of Bosentan Therapy in Patients With Systemic scleRosis and Progressive Digital ulcEr Disease.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"June 1, 2024","Anticipated","Reynold Syndrome","D000007154","Immune System Diseases","Rare","Rare Diseases","Reynold Syndrome","T4991","Reynolds Syndrome","high","D000014456","Ulcer",-,-,-,-,-,-,"Other",-,"Prospective",-,"Digital Ulcers: Lesions (on the fingers or peripheral to the metacarpophalangeal joint), with loss of surface epithelialization and visually distinct depth.

Seventy five percent of the individual affected by the syndrome have a biallelic mutation (258+2T&gt;C and 183-184T &gt; CT). The syndrome results in defects primarily in the pancreas and bone marrow resulting in pancreatic insufficiency, leukopenia with an increased risk of infection and an increased risk for acute myelocytic leukemia. Animal models that have knocked out the function of the SBDS gene in the pancreas reveals at the pancreas at birth as well as the insulin producing cells in the pancreas are normal but subsequently developed fatty infiltration and apoptosis without inflammation resulting in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with initially normal endocrine pancreatic function. The endocrine pancreatic function declines over time such that by 12 months of age these mice show a phenotype of impaired glucose tolerance.

The most serious complication of this disorder, which is common in Puerto Rico, is pulmonary fibrosis, generally fatal in the fourth or fifth decade. There is no treatment for the pulmonary disease of HPS, which resembles idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, a drug called pirfenidone has antifibrotic effects in animal models of lung fibrosis. Pirfenidone is an IND drug initially provided by Marnac, Inc.; InterMune, Inc., now holds the license. Pirfenidone inhibits cytokine-induced inflammation. Reported side effects include gastrointestinal upset, a photosensitivity rash, and palpitations. Between 1997 and 2001, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial under this protocol that found pirfenidone to be safe and efficacious when analyzed using a repeated measures model. Using a random coefficients model, however, the data were definitive only in the restricted group of subjects whose initial forced vital capacity was greater than 50% of predicted.
