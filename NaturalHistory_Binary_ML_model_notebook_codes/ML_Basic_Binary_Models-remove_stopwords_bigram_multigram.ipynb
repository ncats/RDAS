       " 'abstract the natural history of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) typically involves mutations in and/or haploinsuffciency of bmpr2 (gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2) but with low penetrance (10%-15%), delayed onset (in the third or fourth decade), and a gender bias (two- to fourfold more prevalent in postpubertal women). thus, investigators have sought an understanding of \"second-hit\" modalities that might affect bmpr2 anterograde trafficking and/or function. indeed, vascular lung lesions in pah have been reported to contain enlarged \"vacuolated\" endothelial and smooth muscle cells with dilated endoplasmic reticulum (er) cisternae, increased er structural protein reticulon 4 (also called nogo-b), and enlarged and fragmented golgi apparatus. we recently replicated this cellular phenotype in primary human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells in culture by acute knockdown of the estradiol 17œ≤ (e2)-responsive proteins signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a (stat5a) and stat5b using small interfering rnas (sirnas). we have now investigated whether functional haploinsufficiences of these molecules, alone or in combination with other modalities, might interfere with anterograde membrane trafficking using (a) the quantitative tso45vsv-g-gfp trafficking assay and (b) assays for cell-surface localization of flag-tagged bmpr2 molecules. the g glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv-g) trafficking assay was validated in ea.hy926 endothelial cells by showing that cells exposed to monocrotaline pyrrole displayed reduced anterograde trafficking. thereafter, the combinatorial knockdowns of stat5a, stat5b, bmpr2, and/or endothelial nitric oxide synthase as well as exposure to e2 or 2-methoxyestradiol were observed to significantly inhibit vsv-g trafficking. these combinations also led to intracellular trapping of wild-type flag-tagged bmpr2. overexpression of the pah disease-derived f14 and kdf mutants of bmpr2, which were trapped in the er/golgi, also inhibited vsv-g trafficking in trans. moreover, probenecid, a chemical chaperone in clinical use today, partially restored cell-surface localization of the kdf but not the f14 mutant. these data identify several combinatorial modalities that inhibit vsv-g anterograde trafficking and cause mislocalization of bmpr2. these modalities merit consideration in defining aspects of the late-developing and gender-biased natural history of human pah.',\n",

       " 'the relationship between parasite virulence and transmission is a pillar of evolutionary theory that has implications for public health. part of this canon involves the idea that virulence and free-living survival (a key component of transmission) may have different relationships in different host-parasite systems. most examinations of the evolution of virulence-transmission relationships-theoretical or empirical in nature-tend to focus on the evolution of virulence, with transmission being a secondary consideration. even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulence-survival relationships. in this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. across virulence-survival relationships (where these traits are either positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including r0, and on the size of the infectious peak in the population. these results highlight the importance of properly understanding the mechanistic relationship between virulence and parasite survival, as the evolution of increased survival across different relationships with virulence may have considerably different epidemiological signatures.',\n",

       " \"series of patients systematically investigating the outcome of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (nfas) not treated by surgery or radiotherapy during long follow-up periods are limited. most reports involve the follow-up of selected cases of incidentally found lesions, rendering their results unreliable on the assessment of the pros and cons of a 'watch and wait' policy. to investigate the outcome of a series of consecutive patients with presumed nfa (microadenoma or macroadenoma), who were not offered treatment at presentation (for a number of reasons) and were regularly followed up, and to identify possible factors predicting subsequent increase in tumour size. all patients presenting to the department of endocrinology in oxford between 1989 and 2005 with presumed nfa were studied retrospectively. inclusion criteria were: (i) imaging features suggestive of a pituitary adenoma, (ii) no clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hormonal hypersecretion by the tumour, (iii) monitoring being the initial choice of management, and (iv) at least one repeat scan during the follow-up period. subjects presenting with acute apoplexy were excluded. follow-up management included clinical evaluation, assessment of the visual acuity and fields and imaging at regular intervals. the duration of observation was estimated from the dates of first and last scan. forty subjects were included in the study [18 males/22 females, median age 52 years (range 18-89), 16 with microadenoma/24 with macroadenoma]. the mean follow-up period was 42 months (range 8-128). during the observation interval, 12.5% of the microadenomas and 50% of the macroadenomas increased in size. the 48-month probability for enlargement was 19% for the microadenomas and 44% for the macroadenomas. among the subjects with tumour enlargement, 57% showed new or worse visual field defects (all had macroadenomas) and 21% showed chiasmatic involvement on imaging without visual deterioration (all had macroadenomas). new or worse visual field defects were found in 67% of the macroadenomas showing increase in size. no microadenoma enlarged to cause visual deterioration. in microadenomas, sex and age at presentation were not predictors of enlargement. in macroadenomas, sex, age, visual field defects or cavernous sinus invasion at presentation were not predictors of enlargement. the 'watch and wait' policy seems reasonable for microadenomas but is probably not a safe approach for macroadenomas, which appear to have a significant growth potential; in these cases, given the lack of established medical treatment, the decision for surgical intervention should balance the presence of significant comorbidities and the anaesthetic/peri-operative risks at presentation against the probability of tumour enlargement and its consequences, as well as the possible loss of advantages associated with early operation.\",\n",
       " 'most lesions in fd and their attendant functional disability occur within the first decade; 90% of lesions are present by 15 years, and the median age when assistive devices are needed is 7 years. these findings have implications for prognosis and determining the timing and type of therapy. fibrous dysplasia of bone (fd) is an uncommon skeletal disorder in which normal bone is replaced by abnormal fibro-osseous tissue. variable amounts of skeletal involvement and disability occur. the age at which lesions are established, the pace at which the disease progresses, if (or when) the disease plateaus, and how these parameters relate to the onset of disability are unknown. to answer these questions, we performed a retrospective analysis of a group of subjects with fd. one hundred nine subjects with a spectrum of fd were studied for up to 32 years. disease progression was assessed in serial (99)tc-mdp bone scans by determining the location and extent of fd lesions using a validated bone scan scoring tool. physical function and the need for ambulatory aids were assessed. ninety percent of the total body disease skeletal burden was established by age 15. disease was established in a region-specific pattern; in the craniofacial region, 90% of the lesions were present by 3.4 yr, in the extremities, 90% were present by 13.7 yr, and in the axial skeleton, 90% were present by 15.5 yr. twenty-five of 103 subjects eventually needed ambulatory aids. the median age at which assistance was needed was 7 yr (range, 1-43 yr). the median bone scan score for subjects needing assistance was 64.3 (range, 18.6-75) compared with 23.1 (range, 0.5-63.5) in the unassisted subjects (p < 0.0001). among subjects needing assistance with ambulation, 92% showed this need by 17 yr. the majority of skeletal lesions and the associated functional disability occur within the first decade of life. the implication is that the window of time for preventative therapies is narrow. likewise, therapeutic interventions must be tailored to where the patient is in the natural history of the disease (i.e., progressive disease [young] versus established disease [older subjects]). these findings have implications for prognosis, the timing and type of therapy, and the development of trials of new therapies and their interpretation.',\n",

       " 'the autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (arpkd) is generally considered an infantile disorder with the typical presentation of greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys detected in utero or within the neonatal period, often resulting in neonatal demise. however, there is an increasing realization that survivors often thrive into adulthood with complications of the ductal plate malformation, manifesting as congenital hepatic fibrosis and caroli disease, becoming prominent. previous natural history studies have concentrated almost exclusively on the infantile presenting group. however, developments in understanding the genetic basis of arpkd, through identification of the disease gene, pkhd1, have allowed exploration of the etiology in patients with arpkd-like disease or congenital hepatic fibrosis presenting later in childhood or as adults. in the current study we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records, and where possible performed pkhd1 mutation screening, in patients diagnosed with arpkd or congenital hepatic fibrosis at the mayo clinic, rochester, mn, from 1961 to 2004. of a total of 133 cases reviewed, 65 were considered to meet the diagnostic criteria with an average duration of follow-up of 8.6 +/- 6.4 years. fifty-five cases had arpkd and 10 had isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis with no or minimal renal involvement. the patients were analyzed as 3 groups categorized by the age at diagnosis; <1 years (n = 22), 1-20 years (n = 23), and >20 years (n = 20). the presenting feature in the neonates was typically associated with renal enlargement, but in the older groups, more often involved manifestations of liver disease, including hepatosplenomegaly, hypersplenism, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis. during follow-up, 22 patients had renal insufficiency and 8 developed end-stage renal disease (esrd), most from the neonatal group. liver disease was evident on follow-up in all diagnostic groups but particularly prevalent in those diagnosed later in life. a total of 12 patients died, 6 in the neonatal period, but 86% of patients were alive at 40 years of age. the likelihood of being alive without esrd differed significantly between the diagnostic groups with 36%, 80%, and 88% survival in the 3 diagnostic groups, respectively, 20 years after the diagnosis. considerable evidence of intrafamilial phenotype variability was observed. mutation analysis was performed in 31 families and at least 1 mutation was detected in 25 (81%), with 76% of mutant alleles detected in those cases. consistent with the relatively mild disease manifestations in this population, the majority of changes were missense (79%) and no case had 2 truncating changes. mutations were detected in all diagnostic groups, indicating that congenital hepatic fibrosis with minimal kidney involvement can result from pkhd1 mutation. the finding of 6 cases with no detected mutations may represent missed mutations or possible evidence of genetic heterogeneity. the current study indicates a broadened spectrum for the arpkd phenotype and that later presenting cases with predominant liver disease should be considered part of arpkd.',\n",

       " 'the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by frequent exacerbations. majority of exacerbations are infectious and bacteria responsible for 30-50% of these cases. the purpose of this study was to determine the bacteriology of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalized patients in our institution and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern to formulate cost effective antibiotic strategy and reducing the emergence of drug resistance. one hundred and seven clinically diagnosed cases of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admitted in medicine, tuberculosis and chest wards were selected for the study. direct gram stain was done for all sputum samples. the suitable sputum samples were cultured. identification of organism and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by standard microbiological techniques. our study showed growth of pathogenic organisms in 41.12% cases. males (67.29%) are more affected than females (32.71%). gram negative bacilli were more isolated than gram positive cocci. the commonest isolate was klebsiella pneumoniae 15 (38.46%), followed by staphylococcus aureus 9 (23.08%), streptococcus species 6 (15.39%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (10.26%), e.coli 2 (5.13%), acinetobacter species 2 (5.13%) and enterobacter species 1(2.56%). the antibiotic susceptibility reveals that vancomycin, linezolid, azithromycin and clarithromycin were most effective drugs for gram positive cocci, meropenem & piperacillin-tazobactam for gram negative bacilli and amikacin & levofloxacin for both gram positive cocci & gram negative bacilli. in developing country like india acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is common in adults more than 50 years of age due to smoking habits and high indoor pollution. this leads to a major impact on the quality of life of patients with the condition. they are a major cause of hospital admission and health care utilization.',\n",
       " 'immune thrombocytopenic purpura (itp) in children is a common pediatric bleeding disorder with heterogeneous manifestations and a natural history that is not fully understood. to better understand the natural history of chronic itp and detect response trends and outcomes of therapy, we conducted a 10-year retrospective survey of children from age 1 to 18 years with a diagnosis of chronic itp. data on 198 patients from 8 canadian pediatric hematology/oncology centers were analyzed. the majority of patients were female (58%), and were previously diagnosed with acute (primary) itp (85%). the age at diagnosis of chronic itp ranged from 1.1 to 17.2 years with a mean of 8.2+/-4.4 years. ninety percent of patients received some form of treatment. untreated patients had a higher mean platelet count at diagnosis of chronic itp (p=0.009) despite similarities in mean age at first presentation and mean duration of follow-up. thirty-four (17%) patients underwent splenectomy. splenectomized patients tended to be significantly older, had a lower mean platelet count at diagnosis of chronic itp, and had a longer duration of follow-up. the results from this study are consistent with published reports.',\n",
       " \"6-thioguanine (6-tg) has been used as an alternative thiopurine for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients not responsive to or intolerant of azathioprine (aza) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-mp). 6-tg-related hepatotoxicity, including liver biochemistry value elevations, sinusoidal collagen deposition on electron microscopy, and veno-occlusive disease, have been described related to its use as therapy for neoplastic disease. we studied 38 liver biopsies from patients treated with 6-tg, almost all of whom (n = 125) received 6-tg for 1 to 3 years at the inflammatory bowel disease center at cedars-sinai medical center. all biopsies were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and prepared in the usual manner. hematoxylin and eosin, masson's trichrome (trichrome), and reticulin silver impregnation (reticulin) stained slides were studied. in 23 cases, tissue was also prospectively fixed in glutaraldehyde and processed for electron microscopy. in 20 of the 37 patients studied (53%), nodular regeneration of varying degree was seen with reticulin. in only 4 of these 20 instances (11% of the total) were the changes seen with hematoxylin and eosin and in 3 of the 4, only in retrospect after studying the reticulin preparation. minimal fibrosis was seen with trichrome in only 13 biopsies (34%), but sinusoidal collagen deposition was observed in 14 of the 23 cases studied with electron microscopy (60%). the biopsy from the 1 patient with nodular hyperplasia obvious with hematoxylin and eosin also demonstrated changes of venous outflow obstruction. 6-tg-treated ibd patients are at significant risk for nodular hyperplasia, early fibrosis and, less often, venous outflow disease (budd-chiari). the natural history of these changes is unknown and follow-up biopsies are needed to determine histologic and clinical sequela. patients not demonstrating nodular hyperplasia or fibrosis who continue with 6-tg because there are no better therapeutic choices should be periodically rebiopsied.\",\n",
       " 'little is known about the etiological associations and clinical features of extrahepatic primary malignant (ehpm) neoplasms in subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). the aim of this study was to characterize this phenomenon in a consecutive series of spanish patients in order to define its natural history and influence on survival. a retrospective analysis of 245 patients with hcc during the period 1999-2003 was performed. subjects identified with a second primary malignancy elsewhere constituted the ehpm group and were compared to patients with hcc alone. eighteen patients (7.3%) had one or two associated extrahepatic malignancies (mean age 67.7 +/- 9.7 years); of these, 17 had double cancer and one patient, triple. nine of the 19 ehpm occurred before hcc diagnosis. the associated cancers included five cases of colorectal carcinoma, four cases of head and neck carcinoma, three cases of genitourinary cancer, two cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, one lung carcinoma, one skin melanoma, one breast carcinoma, and two cancers of unknown origin. age and sex distribution, etiology of underlying hepatopathy, and liver function tests did not differ significantly between both groups. there was no difference between the overall survival rates. ehpm is not rare among spanish patients with hcc, although no specific clinicopathological features were detected in this population. our results suggest that the association of another primary tumor with hcc does not imply a worse prognosis. the possibility of development of ehpm should be kept in mind when deciding on therapy and follow-up of hcc.',\n",
       " 'to evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with hematological disease admitted to the intensive care unit and the use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation in a subgroup with respiratory dysfunction. a retrospective observational study from september 2011 to january 2014. overall, 157 patients were included. the mean age was 45.13 (¬± 17.2) years and 46.5% of the patients were female. sixty-seven (48.4%) patients had sepsis, and 90 (57.3%) patients required vasoactive vasopressors. the main cause for admission to the intensive care unit was acute respiratory failure (94.3%). among the 157 studied patients, 47 (29.9%) were intubated within the first 24 hours, and 38 (24.2%) underwent noninvasive mechanical ventilation. among the 38 patients who initially received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 26 (68.4%) were subsequently intubated, and 12 (31.6%) responded to this mode of ventilation. patients who failed to respond to noninvasive mechanical ventilation had higher intensive care unit mortality (66.7% versus 16.7%; p = 0.004) and a longer stay in the intensive care unit (9.6 days versus 4.6 days, p = 0.02) compared with the successful cases. baseline severity scores (sofa and saps 3) and the total leukocyte count were not significantly different between these two subgroups. in a multivariate logistic regression model including the 157 patients, intubation at any time during the stay in the intensive care unit and saps 3 were independently associated with intensive care unit mortality, while using noninvasive mechanical ventilation was not. in this retrospective study with severely ill hematologic patients, those who underwent noninvasive mechanical ventilation at admission and failed to respond to it presented elevated intensive care unit mortality. however, only intubation during the intensive care unit stay was independently associated with a poor outcome. further studies are needed to define predictors of noninvasive mechanical ventilation failure.',\n",
